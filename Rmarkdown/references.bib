abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) models have been widely used in educational measurement testing. When there are repeated observations available for individuals through time, a dynamic structure for the latent trait of ability needs to be incorporated into the model, to accommodate changes in ability. Other complications that often arise in such settings include a violation of the common assumption that test results are conditionally independent, given ability and item difficulty, and that test item difficulties may be partially specified, but subject to uncertainty. Focusing on time series dichotomous response data, a new class of state space models, called Dynamic Item Response (DIR) models, is proposed. The models can be applied either retrospectively to the full data or on-line, in cases where real-time prediction is needed. The models are studied through simulated examples and applied to a large collection of reading test data obtained from MetaMetrics, Inc. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

@article{Sanjian1992,
abstract = {This article develops a fuzzy set model of group decision-making and then applies the model to the debate that took place between the NATO states in 1989 over whether to modernize the alliance's short-range nuclear missiles or negotiate a force reduction agreement with the WTO. The NATO partners decided what to do at their May 1989 Brussels summit. From among four discernible courses of action - x1 = modernize, x2 = negotiate, x3 = modernize and negotiate, and x4 = neither modernize nor negotiate - the alliance agreed to negotiate (x2) with the WTO. It is the organization's path to this decision that is conceptualized as being fuzzy. The sixteen NATO allies' individual preference orderings of the four alternatives are first determined via a content analysis of reports on their discussions. These preference orderings are then used to define a fuzzy group preference relation describing the extent to which each alternative is preferred to the others by the entire alliance. Derived from the fuzzy group relation is then NATO's optimal preference ordering (which, at Brussels, was (x2, x4, x3 , x1) as well as the organization's fuzzy level of agreement for that ordering (a very weak .56). Subsequent analysis also reveals that the group's optimal preference ordering was the reverse of the United State's preference ordering at the outset of the summit and identical to the preference ordering of Germany. The implications of this outcome for future NATO decisions are discussed.},

The analysis assesses the changing impact of gang membership, drug sales, and peer gun ownership for protection on gun carrying at nine separate points over the early adolescent to young adult life course. In early adolescence, gang membership is a strong motivation for gun carrying. At somewhat older ages, drug dealing, particularly high drug sales, and illegal peer gun ownership replace gang membership as the primary determinants of illegal gun carrying.

abstract = {The implementations of Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) category to complex multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) scenarios have been included in thousands areas. Outranking methods such as PROMETHEE II are also greatly employed in energy planning application. In MCGDM methods if decision makers (DMs) are not able to treat precise data in order to define their preferences, the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory enables them. IFS attributes are connected with the degree of membership and non-membership, and can be used to draw uncertainty in group decision-making situations. In this paper, a new version of the PROMETHEE II method is proposed, aiming at solving MCGDM problems. Linguistic variables are expressed in the membership function and non-membership function of IFS which are used to assess the weights of all criteria and the ratings of each alternative with respect to each criteria. Conditional normalized Euclidean distance measure is adopted to measure deviations between alternatives on intuitionistic fuzzy set. Then, a ranking algorithm is applied to indicate the order of superiority of alternatives. Finally, a practical example is given to an application of sustainable energy planning to verify our proposed method. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done among the proposed PROMETHEE II method and the intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (IF-TOPSIS) method and elimination and choice translating reality method (IF-ELECTRE).

Using a stratified random sample of 330 households (1,267 individuals aged atleast 18 years) and plurality of well-being dimensions, survey responses are quantified using fuzzy set theory, an approach designed to handle inexact and fuzzy outcomes.

The authors argue that it is impossible to resolve such debates unless researchers focus on patterns of stability and the developmental mechanisms that may give rise to them. To facilitate this shift in emphasis, they describe a formal model that integrates 3 developmental processes: stochastic-contextual processes, person-environment transactions, and developmental constancies. The theoretical and mathematical analyses indicate that this model makes novel predictions about the way in which test-retest correlations are structured across a wide range of ages and test-retest intervals. The authors illustrate the utility of the model by comparing its predictions against meta-analytic data on Neuroticism. The discussion emphasizes the value of focusing on patterns of continuity, not only as phenomena to be explained but as data capable of clarifying the developmental processes underlying stability and change for a variety of psychological constructs.},

Currently in GIS, unlike traditional databases, there is a lack of machine learning algorithms to customize information retrieval results. Thus the particular interests of individual users are not taken into account in traditional geospatial queries. In this paper we present a system that adjusts query results based on user requirements and needs. It does so by using a collection of fuzzy functions that express user preference specifically in GIS environments. The focus of this work is on preference learning for one-dimensional, quantitative attributes, and on the customization of geospatial queries using this information. The model used to express user preferences adjusts gradually to the underlying complexity during a training process, starting with fairly simple linear functions and progressing to complex non-linear ones as needed. Our advanced modeling capabilities are demonstrated through an applicability example, and statistical simulations show the robustness of our system.},

abstract = {Objective: The existing methods of fuzzy soft sets in decision making are mainly based on different kinds of level soft sets, and it is very difficult for decision makers to select a suitable level soft set in most instances. The goal of this paper is to present an approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making to avoid selecting a suitable level soft set and to apply this approach to solve medical diagnosis problems. Methods: This approach combines grey relational analysis with the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. It first utilizes grey relational analysis to calculate the grey mean relational degree, by which we calculate the uncertain degree of various parameters. Then, on the basis of the uncertain degree, the suitable basic probability assignment function of each independent alternative with each parameter can be obtained. Next, we apply Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion to aggregate these alternatives into a collective alternative, by which these alternatives are ranked and the best alternative is obtained. Finally, we compare this approach with the mean potentiality approach. Results: The results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach vis-a-vis the mean potentiality approach, Feng's method, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Naive Bayes' classification method because the measure of performance of this approach is the same as that of the mean potentiality approach, and the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from the initial mean 0.3821 to 0.0069 in an application of medical diagnosis. Conclusion: An approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making by combining grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is introduced. The advantages of this approach are discussed. A practical application to medical diagnosis problems is given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Psychometric theory relies on two basic assumptions: (a) psychological constructs refer to latent (unobservable) variables and (b) psychological tests serve as a way to measure these constructs. This view is complemented by an alternative interpretation of psychological constructs, which neither relies on latent variables nor on the concept of measurement. Using the formal apparatus of many-valued logic, psychological constructs are re-interpreted as linguistic concepts (rather than latent variables), which can be inferred by means of logical calculus (as opposed to measurement). Thus, test scores do not refer to the values of latent variables, but to the degree to which the necessary and sufficient conditions for the ascription of a construct are fulfilled. Following this rationale, a formal theory of psychological tests is developed, which models the process of testing as logical inference. Applying the derived procedures, a person's testing behaviour yields the degree to which a construct describes her adequately. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Online auction has now been a popular mechanism in setting prices for internet users. However, auction price prediction, involving the modeling of uncertainty regarding the bidding process, is a challenging task primarily due to the variety of factors changing in auction settings. Even if all the factors were accounted for, there still exist uncertainties in human behavior when bidding in auctions. In this paper, three models, regression, neural networks and neuro-fuzzy, are constructed to predict the final prices of English auctions, using real-world online auction data collected from Yahoo-Kimo Auction. The empirical results show that the neuro fuzzy system can catch the complicated relationship among the variables accurately much better than the others, which is of great help for the buyers to avoid overpricing and for the sellers to facilitate the auction. Besides, the knowledge base obtained from neuro fuzzy provides the elaborative relationship among the variables, which can be further tested for theory building.

abstract = {Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a high risk for relapses and chronic developments. Clinical characteristics such as residual symptoms have been shown to negatively affect the long-term course of MDD. However, it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as well as cognitive and affective momentary states, the latter experienced during daily-life, affect the long-term course of MDD. Method: We followed up 57 remitted depressed (rMDD) individuals six (T2) and 36 (T3) months after baseline. Clinical outcomes were time to relapse, time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity, and levels of depressive symptoms at T2 and T3. Predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait RNT. Furthermore, momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination, and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment (AA). Results: In multiple models, residual symptoms and instability of daily-life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse, while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait RNT. Multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow-up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily-life rumination. Both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic MDD episodes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that trait RNT, but also affective and cognitive processes during daily life impact the longer-term course of MDD. Future longitudinal research on the role of respective AA-phenotypes as potential transdiagnostic course-modifiers is warranted.},

In these studies, many observations are often obtained for each subject, resulting in what is sometimes termed intensive longitudinal data. As a result, one can characterize not only a subject's mean, but also their variance, and specify models for both. In this chapter, we focus on an adolescent study using EMA where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances, and also allow for a subject-level random effect to the within-subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. These mixed-effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.},

abstract = {In order to reduce costs and enhance their core competitiveness, many companies tend to choose the logistics outsourcing. The selection of logistics outsourcing provider plays an important role for the success of outsourcing. In this paper, we formulate the logistics outsourcing provider selection as a kind of group decision making (GDM) problems with intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs). A new intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming method is proposed for solving such problems. First, we construct an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model to derive priority weights from IFPRs. Depended on the construction of non-membership functions, this intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model is solved by the developed three kinds of approaches including the optimistic, pessimistic and mixed approaches. Then by the idea of TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution), the experts' weights are determined objectively. Combining the experts' weights with the derived priority weights, the corresponding method for GDM with IFPRs is presented. An example of logistics outsourcing provider selection is provided to illustrate the proposed method. Finally, the intuitionistic fuzzy programming method is further generalized to the case of more general membership and non-membership functions.

abstract = {Objective: To investigate how a multilevel item response theory (IRT) model for longitudinal dependent data could provide average and individual quality-of-life outcomes of low-vision rehabilitation. Study Design and Setting: In a nonrandomized longitudinal design, visually impaired older patients (n = 296) were referred to multidisciplinary rehabilitation or to an optometric service. The five-dimensional Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire was administered at four time points. The IRT model was characterized by the graded response model for rating scales. Covariates were added to the model, mainly to correct for missing data. The invariance assumption across time points was investigated. Results: Average and individual rehabilitation effects were estimated. For multidisciplinary rehabilitation, significant average deterioration was seen on three dimensions after 4.4 years. Many individuals in the optometric service group significantly improved on the "reading small print" dimension (18.5{\%}); in both groups, many individuals significantly deteriorated on "visual (motor) skills" (22.2-30.0{\%}). Invariance across time points could be assumed for all dimensions, except for "adjustment." Gender, education, visual acuity, and health status were significantly associated with the outcome. Conclusion: We present how a multilevel IRT model can be applied to describe longitudinal dependent vision-related quality-of-life data, while focusing on average and individual effects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed. },

abstract = {In Business Process Management great attention is given to Computational Intelligence for supporting process life-cycle. Several approaches have been defined to support human decision making. The main drawback is that there are no solid criteria for determining optimal decisions since context, matter of discussion, and involved actors may differ at each execution. This work focuses on the definition of a framework to support and trace human decision making activities, in business processes, when heterogeneous decision-makers have to find a consensus to select most promising alternative to follow. The framework relies on Fuzzy Consensus Model and implements Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn weight of the decision-makers through the analysis of past process executions considering context and performances of business processes. Context awareness relies on semantic web technologies enabling ontological reasoning to evaluate context similarity used to assign the right weight to the involved decision-makers also in the case when more general or more specific context occurs. The framework has been instantiated in the case study of Supply Chain Management. The analysis of the simulation results reveal that the proposed weight learning algorithm and the considered initial weight association strategies (Starting Weight and Training Executions), even if the cold start, give to decision-makers the chance to fill the gap with respect to more experienced decision makers.

This provides it with an important advantage over both crisp set (csQCA) and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). fsQCA is not capable of capturing the causal effect of an intermediate category if, depending on the context, it can have a different impact than the full presence of the corresponding condition. csQCA, in turn, tends to attribute a causal role to the absence of condition values, which in the case of multi-value conditions often encompass very different cases. The article first discusses the comparative advantage of mvQCA with a constructed data set, after which it reanalyzes two published studies to demonstrate these advantages with empirical data.

abstract = {The posterior predictive model checking method is a flexible Bayesian model-checking tool and has recently been used to assess fit of dichotomous IRT models. This paper extended previous research to polytomous IRT models. A simulation study was conducted to explore the performance of posterior predictive model checking in evaluating different aspects of fit for unidimensional graded response models. A variety of discrepancy measures (test-level, item-level, and pair-wise measures) that reflected different threats to applications of graded IRT models to performance assessments were considered. Results showed that posterior predictive model checking exhibited adequate power in detecting different aspects of misfit for graded IRT models when appropriate discrepancy measures were used. Pair-wise measures were found more powerful in detecting violations of the unidimensionality and local independence assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.},

abstract = {The Million Mom March (favoring gun control) and Code Pink: Women for Peace (focusing on foreign policy, especially the war in Iraq) are organizations that have mobilized women as women in an era when other women's groups struggled to maintain critical mass and turned away from non-gender-specific public issues. This article addresses how these organizations fostered collective consciousness among women, a large and diverse group, while confronting the echoes of backlash against previous mobilization efforts by women. We argue that the March and Code Pink achieved mobilization success by creating hybrid organizations that blended elements of three major collective action frames: maternalism, egalitarianism, and feminine expression. These innovative organizations invented hybrid forms that cut across movements, constituencies, and political institutions. Using surveys, interviews, and content analysis of organizational documents, this article explains how the March and Code Pink met the contemporary challenges facing women's collective action in similar yet distinct ways. It highlights the role of feminine expression and concerns about the intersectional marginalization of women in resolving the historic tensions between maternalism and egalitarianism. It demonstrates hybridity as a useful analytical lens to understand gendered organizing and other forms of grassroots collective action.},

abstract = {Latent state-trait (LST) models (Steyer, Ferring, {\&} Schmitt, 1992) allow separating person-specific (trait) effects from (1) effects of the situation and person * situation interactions, and (2) random measurement error in purely observational studies. Typical LST applications use measurement designs in which all situations are sampled randomly and do not have to be known for any individual. Limitations of conventional LST models for only random situations are that traits are implicitly assumed to generalize perfectly across situations, and that main effects of situations are inseparable from person * situation interaction effects because both are measured by the same latent variable. In this article, we show how these limitations can be overcome by using measurement designs in which two or more random situations are nested within two or more fixed situations that are known for each individual. We present extended LST models for the combination of random and fixed situations (LST-RF approach) and show that the extensions allow (1) examining the extent to which traits are situation-specific and (2) isolating person * situation interactions from situation main effects. We demonstrate that the LST-RF approach can be applied with both homogenous and heterogeneous indicators in either the single-or multilevel structural equation modeling frameworks. Advantages and limitations of the new models as well as their relation to other approaches for studying person x situation interactions are discussed.},

abstract = {Borderline personality disorder (PD) historically is construed as an unremitting condition with poor prognosis. In the present study we take a new approach to examining stability and change in borderline PD by explaining symptom expression in terms of an unchanging foundation—termed borderline proneness—on one hand, and transitory influences on the other. We monitored borderline PD symptoms annually in a large sample of high-risk adolescent girls (N = 2,450) from ages 14 to 20. Trait-state-occasion modeling revealed that just more than half (52{\%}–57{\%}) of borderline PD symptom variation was attributable to fixed borderline proneness, whereas the remainder was subject to change across yearly measurement occasions. This degree of stability was no larger than the corresponding estimate for depression, a condition known for its variable course. Our results indicate that, contrary to its reputation, borderline pathology is not set in stone, and it fluctuates in response to situational influences.},

abstract = {PURPOSE An item response theory (IRT) pharmacometric framework is presented to characterize Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) data in locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or capecitabine-plus-lapatinib. METHODS In the IRT model, four latent well-being variables, based on FACT-B general subscales, were used to describe the physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being. Each breast cancer subscale item was reassigned to one of the other subscales. Longitudinal changes in FACT-B responses and covariate effects were investigated. RESULTS The IRT model could describe both item-level and subscale-level FACT-B data. Non-Asian patients showed better baseline social/family and functional well-being than Asian patients. Moreover, patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 had better baseline physical and functional well-being. Well-being was described as initially increasing or decreasing before reaching a steady-state, which varied substantially between patients and subscales. T-DM1 exposure was not related to any of the latent variables. Physical well-being worsening was identified in capecitabine-plus-lapatinib-treated patients, whereas T-DM1-treated patients typically stayed stable. CONCLUSION The developed framework provides a thorough description of FACT-B longitudinal data. It acknowledges the multi-dimensional nature of the questionnaire and allows covariate and exposure effects to be evaluated on responses.},

A summary of these officials' impressions and recommendations precedes individual reports on the following cities: Phoenix, Ariz.; Los Angeles; Denver; Miami; Chicago; Detroit; Minneapolis; St. Louis; Cleveland; Memphis, Tenn.; Dallas; Richmond, Va.; Seattle; and Milwaukee. All community leaders agreed that their cities had suffered a marked increase in public fear of crime. Most felt that rehabilitative methods for treating criminal behavior had failed and that sensitivity to the rights of the accused should be secondary to concerns for the rights of the victim and society. The survey indicated that confidence in the ability of government to protect lives and property had diminished strikingly and was being supplanted by self-reliance measures such as fortressing, neighborhood crime watch programs, and private gun ownership. Community leaders identified seven major causes of crime: failure of the criminal justice system, loss of traditional values, unemployment, media and politicians, growth and mobility, drugs and alcohol, and guns. Local citizen participation in anticrime programs received the most enthusiastic and widespread support as a remedy to reduce crime and its attendant fear. Other frequently proposed solutions were increased funds for law enforcement, swift and certain punishment, and victim assistance and restitution. No single recommendation was perceived as a panacea to crime problems, but all were viewed instead as an overall prescription to keep the malady in a state of remission. Graphs and a list of the newspaper articles which provided the basis for this report are included. (Author summary modified)},

abstract = {Argues that one solution to the problem of establishing replicable generalizations in psychological research lies in aggregating behavior over situations and/or occasions, thereby canceling out incidental, uncontrollable factors relative to experimental factors. Such a procedure increases reliability without introducing excessive constraints into the experimental situation. The value of such aggregation was demonstrated in 4 studies in Part I of this paper (Epstein, 1979) that examined a variety of data, including the subjective and objective measurement of behavior in the field and in the laboratory. Four kinds of aggregation are discussed, each of which reduces a specific source of error. The degree of aggregation that is required varies inversely with the degree to which the events studied are ego-involving, implicitly or explicitly include an adequate sample of behavioral observation, or have been demonstrated to be robust over incidental sources of variation. },

Fuzzy membership functions of basic human values and their priorities were prepared by utilizing Schwartz's model of basic human values (achievement, benevolence, conformity, hedonism, power, security, self-direction, stimulation, tradition and universalism). The quality of the model was tested on 'the most attractive font face problem' and it was evaluated using the following criteria: a speed of optimal parameters computation, a precision of achieved results, Wilcoxon signed rank test and a similarity of letter images.

abstract = {To elucidate the multidimensional nature of poverty, this study analyzed child deprivation and social exclusion in Taiwan. First, a fuzzy set approach was used to construct an aggregate poverty index, to measure the levels of perceived necessity, deprivation, and social exclusion experienced by children. The study involved conducting a decomposition analysis to measure the poverty index according to certain dimensions. Second, this study involved analyzing possible determinants of perceived necessity, deprivation, and social exclusion, using seemingly unrelated regression models. We used cross-sectional data obtained from the Household Living Conditions Survey conducted in 2014. The results suggest that over two-thirds of the respondents identified all the items as necessary. Three highest levels of perceived necessity were housing, medical care, and clothing dimensions. Children faced high risks of deprivation and exclusion. The three highest levels of deprivation and exclusion were exhibited in the dimensions of environment, recreation, and education; the lowest two levels of deprivation and exclusion were exhibited in the dimensions of medical care and housing. The dimensions with higher levels of deprivation and exclusion exhibited higher relative contributions to facilitating poverty reduction. Moreover, evaluation of income and expenditure, family income, and family type were significantly related to the degree of perceived necessity and the levels of deprivation and exclusion. Those living in families with a large number of children exhibited a higher level of deprivation. Education of the caregivers was closely linked to social exclusion of children. This paper represents preliminary and small-scale research; however, several implications for methodology and policy can be derived from this study.

abstract = {Recent research identifies internal self-concept motivation and instrumental motivation as having positive and negative effects, respectively, on the performance of research scientists. However, the majority of research examining the work motivations of research scientists employs bad research practices. The current study presents an alternative view of the relations between work motivations and research performance through the examination of causal recipes of research performance. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of a random sample of 300 UK scientists identifies recipes of work motivations that effectively foster high levels of research performance. Contrary to prior liner examinations of the relations between motivation and performance, results show that no unique combination of antecedent work motivations yield higher levels of research performance. This finding suggests that several combinations of work motivations can successfully drive high levels of research performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Based on data regarding the acquisition of firearms by the respondents, legitimate firearms retailers play a minor role as direct sources of the criminal handgun supply. Most of the respondents obtained weapons from theft, either directly or indirectly. Weapons obtained through cash or trades from friends or relatives were most likely stolen weapons. This suggests that the weapons market for felons can only be seriously affected by thwarting weapons theft and the informal sale of weapons. Regarding a ban on the manufacture or sale of cheap handguns, the study data indicate that the handguns preferred and most recently owned by the respondents, particularly those most inclined to use guns in crime, were more expensive, larger handguns. When respondents were queried about their response to various types of handgun controls, there was no indication that such controls would result in the use of less lethal weapons. Respondents would either secure more expensive, larger handguns or resort to the use of sawed-off shoulder weapons. Tabular data, subject index, 65-item bibliography.

abstract = {Presents results from a national random digit dial telephone survey of 1,906 US adults conducted in the spring of 1996. Ss were asked about hostile gun displays and use of guns and other weapons in self-defense at home in the past five years. The objective of the survey was to assess the relative frequency and characteristics of weapons-related events at home. 13 Ss reported that a gun was displayed against them at home, 2 reported using a gun in self-defense at home, and 24 reported using another weapon (e.g. knife, baseball bat) in home self-defense. While we do not always know whose weapon was used in these incidents, most gun brandishings were by male intimates against women. A gun in the home can be used against family members or intruders and can be used not only to kill and wound, but to intimidate and frighten. This small study provides some evidence that guns may be used at least as often by family members to frighten intimates as to thwart crime, and that other weapons are far more commonly used against intruders than are guns.

abstract = {This study examines the enduring spatial and racial dimensions of poverty and deprivation in South Africa to assess the progress made by the post-apartheid society and state. A multi-dimensional approach is required to assess progress because it can reflect the reduction in deprivation attributable to the improved affordability and expanded coverage of government services. While there has been previous studies tracking poverty trends over segments of the post-apartheid period, no previous work has considered multi-dimensional deprivation over the two decades following the official fall of apartheid. We adopt the Total Fuzzy and Relative (TFR) approach proposed by Cheli and Lemmi (Econ Notes 24(1):115-134, 1995) to derive a poverty index with nine dimensions of deprivation, including education, employment, dwelling type, overcrowding, access to electricity, water, telephone, sanitation and refuse collection. Our analysis shows that there has been a significant improvement in deprivation levels between 1996 and 2011, but it also finds that geography and race continue to play an important role in explaining patterns of deprivation.

abstract = {Community involvement in local firearms policy is advocated to be an important component of efforts to curtail violence. This report describes the first evaluation of one such effort, a gun buy-back program conducted in Seattle, WA, during the fall of 1992. The evaluation included (a) surveys of 500 participants and a description of the firearms exchanged; (b) monitoring police reports, trauma center admissions, and medical examiners' data to assess short-term effects on the frequency of firearm-related events; and (c) an assessment of community beliefs by random-digit dialing telephone interviews of 1,000 residents. Of the 1,172 firearms relinquished, 95 percent were handguns, 83 percent were operational, and 67 percent were owned for more than 5 years. Twenty-five percent were exchanged by women. The mean age of participants in the exchange program was 51 years. Females and persons in older age groups were more likely than males (83 percent versus 70 percent, P {\textless}0.01) and minors (88 percent versus 55 percent, P {\textless}0.05) to select safe disposal as motivation to participate. Comparing firearm-related events per month before and after the program, crimes and deaths increased, and injuries decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant. Telephone interviews revealed broad support for publicly funded gun buy-back programs even among households (61 percent) with firearms. Gun buy-back programs are a broadly supported means to decrease voluntarily the prevalence of handguns within a community, but their effect on decreasing violent crime and reducing firearm mortality is unknown.},

abstract = {Despite living in difficult and socially disorganized conditions, some individuals displaced by disasters and living in FEMA parks can be remarkably resilient to depression. We conceptualize resilience as emerging from a combination of situational advantages that accrue for some residents but not for others. We assess whether situational advantages lead to resilience, either in isolation or in combination with one another, in two parts. First, we used a delimited person-centered analysis (PCA) to identify advantages present among the most resilient and absent among the least resilient FEMA park residents. Second, we used fuzzy-set analysis (FSA) to systematically uncover advantageous individual-level conditions that were consistent among resilient individuals using the full sample of FEMA park respondents. Implications for sociological theory and disaster mental health research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Richmond, 1985), a measure of the Physiological Reactivity, Worry-Oversensitivity, and Social Alienation dimensions of anxiety. A latent variable (trait-state-occasion) model and a latent growth curve model were applied to each of the 3 anxiety dimensions and to a general anxiety factor consisting of the 3 dimensions. Although the general anxiety factor reflected a significant stable trait process, the Worry-Oversensitivity and Social Alienation dimensions reflected an autoregressive process more than a stable trait dimension. In contrast to the other 2 anxiety dimensions, Physiological Reactivity reflected a significant stable trait process, suggesting that the longitudinal structure of anxiety in children depends upon the dimension assessed. In children as early as age 9 or 10, Physiological Reactivity (more than other anxiety dimensions) manifested a stable trait component. Structural findings were consistent across gender and race; however, mean differences in gender and race emerged for general anxiety and its 3 dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {The size of a model has been shown to critically affect the goodness of approximation of the model fit statistic T to the asymptotic chi-square distribution in finite samples. It is not clear, however, whether this “model size effect” is a function of the number of manifest variables, the number of free parameters, or both. It is demonstrated by means of 2 Monte Carlo computer simulation studies that neither the number of free parameters to be estimated nor the model degrees of freedom systematically affect the T statistic when the number of manifest variables is held constant. Increasing the number of manifest variables, however, is associated with a severe bias. These results imply that model fit drastically depends on the size of the covariance matrix and that future studies involving goodness-of-fit statistics should always consider the number of manifest variables, but can safely neglect the influence of particular model specifications.},

The model jointly captured the multifaceted nature of cognition and its longitudinal trajectory. The word list learning and delayed recall tasks carried the most information. Greater age at baseline, fewer years of education, and positive APOEE4 carrier status were associated with a faster cognitive decline.

abstract = {Functional Somatic Symptoms (FSS) are physical symptoms that cannot be attributed to underlying pathology. Their severity is often measured with sum scores on questionnaires; however, this may not adequately reflect FSS severity in subgroups of patients. We aimed to identify the items of the somatization section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview that best discriminate FSS severity levels, and to assess their functioning in sex and age subgroups. We applied the two-parameter logistic model to 19 items in a population-representative cohort of 962 participants. Subsequently, we examined differential item functioning (DIF). "Localized (muscle) weakness" was the most discriminative item of FSS severity. "Abdominal pain" consistently showed DIF by sex, with males reporting it at higher FSS severity. There was no consistent DIF by age, however, "Joint pain" showed poor discrimination of FSS severity in older adults. These findings could be helpful for the development of better assessment instruments for FSS, which can improve both future research and clinical care.},

abstract = {When time-intensive longitudinal data are used to study daily-life dynamics of psychological constructs (e.g., well-being) within persons over time (e.g., by means of experience sampling methodology), the measurement model (MM)—indicating which constructs are measured by which items—can be affected by time- or situation-specific artifacts (e.g., response styles and altered item interpretation). If not captured, these changes might lead to invalid inferences about the constructs. Existing methodology can only test for a priori hypotheses on MM changes, which are often absent or incomplete. Therefore, we present the exploratory method “latent Markov factor analysis” (LMFA), wherein a latent Markov chain captures MM changes by clustering observations per subject into a few states. Specifically, each state gathers validly comparable observations, and state-specific factor analyses reveal what the MMs look like. LMFA performs well in recovering parameters under a wide range of simulated conditions, and its empirical value is illustrated with an example.},

abstract = {Relationships among rumination, social support, and negative affect were examined using a daily process methodology. Trait rumination predicted subsequent daily rumination about daily family stress. However, findings from multilevel modeling indicated that these effects were moderated by social support. Social support also attenuated the effect of state rumination on negative affect. When those higher in support ruminated, the effect on negative affect was buffered as compared to those lower in social support. Although our findings suggest that those high in trait rumination are more likely to respond to daily stressors with increases in daily rumination, we found that this effect too was attenuated among those with higher social support. Trait rumination was more strongly predictive of daily rumination among those who reported lower social support. Implications for models of rumination are discussed within a social contextual framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Many learners' characteristics may be considered to provide personalized learning that fit into individual's needs. Understanding individual differences in learning is an important issue in educational psychology. Many studies attest that learning process can be more effective by considering personality traits. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy inference system, ALPIS, to identify the Big-Five Personality from learner's network behaviors. The proposed system had been implemented through MATLAB fuzzy tools. We conducted an experimental study in real e-learning environment with 53 students (29 male and 24 female) to evaluate the ALPIS performance. Comparing to the conventional inventory-based psychological analysis (NEO-FFI) we demonstrate that learners' personality can be predicted with reasonable precision based on their online behaviors. Experiments have shown that ALPIS is able to automatically detect learners' personality with accuracy at least 78{\%} on medium Agreeableness category and 97{\%} on low extroversion category. Because of using learners' behaviors ALPIS provides a reasonable precision in personality detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods In Study 1 ( N = 104), online participants rated the frequency of and motivation for experiences of authenticity and inauthenticity. Studies 2 ( N = 268) and 3 ( N = 93) asked (local or online, respectively) participants to describe their experiences of authenticity or inauthenticity. Participants in Studies 1 and 2 also completed measures of trait authenticity, and participants in Study 3 rated their experience with respect to several phenomenological dimensions. Results Study 1 demonstrated that people are motivated to experience state authenticity and avoid inauthenticity and that such experiences are common, regardless of one's degree of trait authenticity. Coding of Study 2's narratives identified the emotions accompanying and needs fulfilled in each state. Trait authenticity generally did not qualify the nature of (in)authentic experiences. Study 3 corroborated the results of Study 2 and further revealed positive mood and nostalgia as consequences of reflecting on experiences of authenticity.

abstract = {Recidivism remains a serious issue in the modern criminal justice system, with over 80{\%} of those previously incarcerated being rearrested within 9 years of release (Alper, Durose, {\&} Markman, 2018). Although previous studies have identified risk factors that increase the probability of rearrest, much remains unknown regarding the full constellation of risk factors. One potential risk factor that has received limited attention is intelligence, as individuals with lower IQ scores have been found to be more likely to come into initial contact with the criminal justice system. Collectively, previous studies have provided preliminary evidence of intelligence as a risk factor for rearrest but have not fully explored this association. More specifically, it remains unclear whether the association between IQ and recidivism persists after controlling for time-invariant, individual-specific sources of variance in criminal behavior. The current study aimed to address this limitation and more closely examine the longitudinal association between IQ and rearrest with data from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 1,331 individuals). To distinguish variance in intelligence from time-stable, individual-specific variance in criminality, we estimated a latent trait-state- occasion model. A subsequent series of survival models, which included the previously estimated measure of criminality as a covariate, revealed a small and negative association between IQ and rearrest (hazard ratio = .95; 95{\%} confidence interval [.92; .98]), suggesting that IQ may play only a minor role in recidivism.},

The results of an exploratory factor analysis indicated the construct validity of the goals. In Study 2, students completed trait and state scales in different weeks (N = 542) and repeatedly after 12 weeks each. Confirmatory factor analyses as well as correlations with state and trait reference constructs confirmed the convergent and differential validity of both the trait and the state goal factors. The instrument offers a brief, reliable, and valid measure of multiple state and trait goals. Latent state trait analyses revealed that some state goals are surprisingly robust against situational influences and equally stable across time as corresponding trait goals, whereas other goals are more dependent on the learning situation.},

The results of the investigation show a different mechanism of determinants of quality of work for disabled and non-disabled people: while for these last ones seniority seem to highly contribute to the score of quality of work, institutional factors, like Law 68/99, whose aim is the regulation and promotion of the employment of persons with disabilities, appear to play a bigger role in the determination of the score for quality of work for disabled people. For medium and high levels of score of quality of work, education appears to play a similar role for disabled and non-disabled people, as the incidence of people with high quality jobs corresponds to people with a high level of education. However, for disabled people who are in low quality jobs the level of education appears to be irrelevant. Substantial differences emerge with respect to gender among disabled people, where women appear to be in higher quality of work scores than men; no substantial difference between genders emerges for non-disabled people.

abstract = {In this paper, a fuzzy expert system based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is introduced to assess the mortality after coronary bypass surgery. In preprocessing phase, the attributes were reduced using a univariant analysis in order to make the classifier system more effective. Prognostic factors with a p-value of less than 0.05 in chi-square or t-student analysis were given to inputs ANFIS classifier. The correct diagnosis performance of the proposed fuzzy system was calculated in 824 samples. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, the study compared the performance of fuzzy system based on ANFIS method through the binary logistic regression with the same attributes. The experimental results showed that the fuzzy model (accuracy: 96.4{\%}; sensitivity: 66.6{\%}; specificity: 97.2{\%}; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.82) consistently outperformed the logistic regression (accuracy: 89.4{\%}; sensitivity: 47.6{\%}; specificity: 89.4{\%}; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.62). The obtained classification accuracy of fuzzy expert system was very promising with regard to the traditional statistical methods to predict mortality after coronary bypass surgery such as binary logistic regression model.

abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent "statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a $\chi$2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

abstract = {Experiential avoidance (EA), the tendency to avoid internal, unwanted thoughts and feelings, is hypothesized to be a risk factor for social anxiety. Existing studies of experiential avoidance rely on trait measures with minimal contextual consideration. In two studies, we examined the association between experiential avoidance and anxiety within real-world social interactions. In the first study, we examined the effect of experiential avoidance on social anxiety in everyday life. For 2 weeks, 37 participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 38 healthy controls provided reports of experiential avoidance and social anxiety symptoms during face-to-face social interactions. Results showed that momentary experiential avoidance was positively related to anxiety symptoms during social interactions and this effect was stronger among people with SAD. People low in EA showed greater sensitivity to the level of situational threat than high EA people. In the second study, we facilitated an initial encounter between strangers. Unlike Study 1, we experimentally created a social situation where there was either an opportunity for intimacy (self-disclosure conversation) or no such opportunity (small-talk conversation). Results showed that greater experiential avoidance during the self-disclosure conversation temporally preceded increases in social anxiety for the remainder of the interaction; no such effect was found in the small-talk conversation. Our findings provide insight into the association between experiential avoidance on social anxiety in laboratory and naturalistic settings, and demonstrate that the effect of EA depends upon level of social threat and opportunity.},

The combined weighted geometric averaging (CWGA) operator is extended into the case with IT2 FSs variables, which can take both the importance of individual and its relative position into account. Afterwards, a solution process for the FLMCGDM problems is proposed, in which the new equivalence clustering method and CWGA operator of IT2 FSs is incorporated. Finally, the reasonability and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by an illustrative example. Compared with other methods, the IT2-FEC analysis can deal with the linguistic variables and produce dynamic clustering results in a more efficient way.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE For people living with HIV, treatment adherence self-efficacy is an important predictor of treatment adherence and, therefore, of clinical outcomes. Using experience sampling method (ESM), this study aimed to examine: (1) the within-person association between moment-to-moment changes in social support and HIV treatment self-efficacy; (2) the moderators of this within-person association; (3) the concordance between questionnaire and ESM measurement of treatment self-efficacy; and (4) the utility of each approach (ESM and questionnaire) in predicting adherence to medication, adherence to clinic visits, CD4 counts, and viral load. METHOD Men living with HIV (N = 109) responded to the same set of ESM questions 3 times a day for 7 days via a smart phone given to them for the study. They also completed cross-sectional questionnaires and their clinic data was extracted from medical records to examine predictors and consequences of state and trait treatment self-efficacy. RESULTS In within-person hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses, receipt of recent social support predicted higher current ESM treatment self-efficacy. This association was stronger for individuals reporting higher avoidance coping with HIV. The correlation between ESM and questionnaire measures of treatment self-efficacy was r = .37. ESM measure of average treatment self-efficacy predicted medication adherence, visit adherence, CD4 counts, and viral load, while questionnaire-based self-efficacy did not predict these outcomes. CONCLUSION Interventions aimed at improving treatment adherence may target social support processes, which may improve treatment self-efficacy and adherence. (PsycINFO Database Record},

The resulting data are analyzed with dynamic models to capture regulatory processes involved in emotional functioning. Daily contexts, however, are commonly ignored. This may not only result in biased parameter estimates and wrong conclusions, but also ignores the opportunity to investigate contextual effects on emotional dynamics. With fixed moderated time series analysis, we present an approach that resolves this problem by estimating context-dependent change in dynamic parameters in single-subject time series models. The approach examines parameter changes of known shape and thus addresses the problem of observed intra-individual heterogeneity (e.g., changes in emotional dynamics due to observed changes in daily stress). In comparison to existing approaches to unobserved heterogeneity, model estimation is facilitated and different forms of change can readily be accommodated. We demonst...},

abstract = {In a community sample of 52 adolescents, multilevel growth curve modeling was utilized to examine whether within-person changes in momentary mood states, and individual differences in trait emotional functioning, were related to adolescent cortisol levels in naturalistic settings. Salivary cortisol levels were measured seven times a day on two typical weekdays in conjunction with diary reports of adolescent mood states. Questionnaire reports of trait emotional functioning (depression, anxiety, and anger) were obtained, as were reports of demographic, developmental, and health control variables. After accounting for the effects of time of day and a wide range of control variables, within-person increases in state negative mood (worry/stress and anger/frustration) were significantly associated with within-person increases in cortisol. When examining trait emotional functioning, adolescents with higher levels of depressive symptoms had slightly lower basal cortisol levels, and adolescents with higher levels of trait anger had a significantly stronger cortisol response to awakening. Several developmental effects were found—adolescents at higher stages of pubertal development had daytime basal cortisol curves that were more elevated, had a steeper diurnal decline, and showed a lesser cortisol awakening response, and cortisol responses to worry/stress increased with age. Cortisol levels were also higher at moments adolescents were alone rather than with others, an effect that declined significantly with age. Cortisol levels were also higher at moments adolescents were alone rather than with others, an effect that declined significantly with age. Results suggest that ongoing transactions occur between adolescents' everyday emotional experiences and their cortisol levels, and that adolescent cortisol activity is modified by age/pubertal stage and by trait emotional functioning.},

To reveal the dynamic relations between the variables, their (auto- or cross-) regressive effects across time may be inspected by fitting a lag-one vector autoregressive, or VAR(1), model and visualizing the resulting regression coefficients as the edges of a weighted directed network. Usually, the raw VAR(1) regression coefficients are drawn, but we argue that this may yield misleading network figures and characteristics because of two problems. First, the raw regression coefficients are sensitive to scale and variance differences among the variables and therefore may lack comparability, which is needed if one wants to calculate, for example, centrality measures. Second, they only represent the unique direct effects of the variables, which may give a distorted picture when variables correlate strongly. To deal with these problems, we propose to use other VAR(1)-based measures as edges. Sp...},

It is maintained that this relation can be interpreted as a causal one but that in measurement models for interindividual differences the relation does not apply to the level of the individual person. To substantiate intraindividual causal conclusions, one must explicitly represent individual level processes in the measurement model. Several research strategies that may be useful in this respect are discussed, and a typology of constructs is proposed on the basis of this analysis.

We propose a factor analytical model that distinguishes between four independent sources of variance: common trait, unique trait, common state, and unique state. We show that by testing whether there is weak factorial invariance across the trait and state factor structures, we can tackle the fundamental question first raised by Cattell; that is, are within-person state dimensions qualitatively the same as between-person trait dimensions? Furthermore, we discuss how this model is related to other trait-state factor models, and we illustrate its use with two empirical data sets. We end by discussing the implications for cross-sectional factor analysis and suggest potential future developments.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of intensive longitudinal research designs to study within-person processes. Examples are studies that use experience sampling data and autoregressive modeling to investigate emotion dynamics and between-person differences therein. Such designs often involve multiple measurements per day and multiple days per person, and it is not clear how this nesting of the data should be accounted for: That is, should such data be considered as two-level data (which is common practice at this point), with occasions nested in persons, or as three-level data with beeps nested in days which are nested in persons. We show that a significance test of the day-level variance in an empty three-level model is not reliable when there is autocorrelation. Furthermore, we show that misspecifying the number of levels can lead to spurious or misleading findings, such as inflated variance or autoregression estimates. Throughout the paper we present instructions and R code for the implementation of the proposed models, which includes a novel three-level AR(1) model that estimates moment-to-moment inertia and day-to-day inertia. Based on our simulations we recommend model selection using autoregressive multilevel models in combination with the AIC. We illustrate this method using empirical emotion data from two independent samples, and discuss the implications and the relevance of the existence of a day level for the field.},

This study presents a new theoretical perspective on causal core and periphery factors for MOOC-intensiveness in universities using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). The findings show how this new theoretical perspective allows for two different typologies. Different configurations lead to an outcome combination of different core and peripheral conditions building on internal, strategic, and external factors. However, the two configurations leading to the absence of the outcome simply refer to the absence of a strategic factor (university prestige) or of an internal factor (low number of faculty).

Exacerbating the minimization problem was the highly misleading way opponents of handgun ownership selected and presented pre-1980s lawful homicide data. On the basis of only anti-gun polls, it is now clear that handguns are used as or more often in repelling crimes annually as in committing them, approximately 645,000 defense uses annually versus about 580,000 criminal misuses. 69 notes},

abstract = {The ICVS has found three main types of crime-prevention measures are commonly used to protect households from burglary: behaviors adopted by the household members in order to prevent crimes, physical devices used to make the access of unauthorized persons to the residence more difficult, and the establishment of community-based initiatives that involve other parties in crime prevention. Between 1992 and 1996, the use or installation of burglar alarms increased in most countries in Western Europe, the New World, and countries in transition. Neighborhood Watch schemes were found to be popular in the New World, Asia, and Western Europe, but much less so in other regions. The highest firearms ownership rates were found in the New World and Western Europe, followed by Latin America and countries in transition; however, the reasons for gun ownership varied from country to country. Not all the firearms were meant to be used for crime prevention purposes. The principle of sharing crime prevention responsibilities with the community has been widely accepted, and many governments place crime prevention programs that involve citizens, law enforcement, and all relevant components of society among the highest national priorities. The International Centre for the Prevention of Crime has identified three main areas for effective crime prevention: increasing formal and informal crime prevention measures; preventing offending and re-offending by targeting groups at risk and providing them with education and recreation opportunities, as well as housing and employment; and specific target-hardening through a broader use of individual and household precautionary measures.},

This paper employs the posterior predictive model-checking method, a popular Bayesian model-checking tool, to examine item fit for the above-mentioned models. An item fit plot, comparing the observed and predicted proportion-correct scores of examinees with different raw scores, is suggested. This paper also suggests how to obtain posterior predictive p-values (which are natural Bayesian p-values) for the item fit statistics of Orlando and Thissen that summarize numerically the information in the above-mentioned item fit plots. A number of simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested item fit diagnostics. The suggested techniques seem to have adequate power and reasonable Type I error rate, and psychometricians will find them promising.},

However, some of its characteristics, especially those of its fuzzy set variant, are still not well understood by users. QCA, a set theoretic method, aims to describe, in a Boolean form, the configurations of conditions that are necessary and/or sufficient for some outcome. The calibration of set memberships is a central feature. We discuss how two alternative calibrations of a condition affect the assessment of consistency with sufficiency. Using first an abstract example and then an empirical one from the sociology of education, we explain why 'stricter' calibration of conditions results in higher consistency with sufficiency. We demonstrate that conventional truth table analysis is not an ideal way to compare the analytic consequences of alternative calibrations and therefore employ an alternative which allows a more direct comparison of consistency indices while keeping comparative configurational contexts intact.

abstract = {Increases in mindfulness are assumed to lead to improvements in psychological well-being during mindfulness-based treatments. However, the temporal order of this association has received little attention. This intensive longitudinal study examines whether within-person changes in mindfulness precede or follow changes in negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) during a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program. This study also examines interindividual differences in the association between mindfulness and affect and possible predictors of these differences. Mindfulness, NA, and PA were assessed on a daily basis in 83 individuals from the general population who participated in an MBSR program. Multilevel autoregressive models were used to investigate the temporal order of changes in mindfulness and affect. Day-to-day changes in mindfulness predicted subsequent day-to-day changes in both NA and PA, but reverse associations did not emerge. Thus, changes in mindfulness seem to precede rather than to follow changes in affect during MBSR. The magnitude of the effects differed substantially between individuals, showing that the strength of the relationship between mindfulness and affect is not the same for all participants. These between-subjects differences could not be explained by gender, age, level of education, average level of mindfulness home practice, or baseline levels of mindfulness and affect. Mindfulness home practice during the day did predict subsequent increases in mindfulness. The findings suggest that increasing mindfulness on a daily basis can be a beneficial means to improve daily psychological well-being.},

The number of these inequality constraints increase dramatically with the number of response categories per item, if assumptions like monotohicity or double monotonicity of the cumulative category response functions are postulated. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the Gibbs sampler, can sample from the multivariate posterior distribution of the parameters under the constraints. Bayesian model selection can be done by posterior predictive checks and Bayes factors. A simulation study is done to evaluate results of the application of these methods to ordered latent class models in three realistic situations. Also, an example of the presented methods is given for existing data with polytomous items. It can be concluded that the Bayesian estimation procedure can handle the inequality constraints on the parameters very well. However, the application of Bayesian model selection methods requires more research.},

In general equilibrium, there exists a locally stable steady state where believing and frequent church attendance is widespread across the social strata.

abstract = {Research Problem: Why circumstantial variables such as employment and marital status appear to have limited effect on subjective well-being while certain circumstances are clearly associated with happiness in everyday parlance? Hypothesis: There exist multiple causal paths to happiness. Rather than each variable exerting clear effect, it is combinations of causal conditions that affect the level of happiness. Alternative hypothesis is that no discernible path to happiness is found or that causal paths to happiness are not diversified. Data and Methods: The fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was employed. Findings: Happiness is a multi-causal, multi-path phenomenon. For some individuals, primary ties such as marriage and children are crucial, while for others, health is a key to happiness. Income and education also matter to some individuals, but not to everyone. Implications: Research on happiness would achieve more nuanced and contextualized understanding of happiness by supplementing its variable-centered perspective on happiness with case-centered perspective that takes into account differential relevance of causal combinations.

This advance upon SDT promises to improve measurement of performance in domains in which stimuli do not fall into discrete, mutually exclusive categories; a situation which characterizes many detection problems in real-world operational contexts. FSDT allows for events to simultaneously be in more than one state category (e.g., both signal and nonsignal). The present study derived FSDT Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) functions to test whether application of FSDT meets the Gaussian and equal variance assumptions of traditional SDT and, therefore, whether the standard representation of the SDT decision space can be extended to the broader case of FSDT. Results supported the contention that FSDT does meet these traditional SDT assumptions, and further, that it yields higher sensitivity scores than traditional SDT when the category membership of events is ambiguous. ROC analyses indicate that use of traditional SDT formulas with fuzzy hit and false alarm rates is thus justified. The implications of this advance to both theoretical and practical domains are adumbrated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

To address the situations where the elements in a set are correlative, several Shapley weighted correlation coefficients are presented. It is worth noting that the Shapley weighted correlation coefficient can be seen as an extension of the correlation coefficient based on additive measures. When the weight information of attributes is partly known, models for the optimal fuzzy measure on an attribute set are constructed. After that, an approach to clustering analysis and decision making under hesitant fuzzy environment with incomplete weight information and interactive conditions is developed. Meanwhile, corresponding examples are provided to verify the practicality and feasibility of the new approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (EHFLTSs) are helpful to model uncertain linguistic information in qualitative group decision making (QGDM). Total orders are essential whenever more than two EHFLTSs have to be compared, such as aggregating them by the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator. However, the existing studies only focus on partial orders of EHFLTSs and thus their application may be limited. The main purpose of this paper is to develop total orders of EHFLTSs. A constructive approach is proposed to generate total orders by aggregation functions. Three distinct total orders are defined for potential applications as well. To clarify the importance of total orders in QGDM, the extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic OWA operator is developed and some properties are demonstrated. Finally, based on the proposed techniques and the social choice theory, an approach formed by two algorithms is presented to solve the QGDM problems in which some necessary parameters, e.g. risk preferences, are complicated to determine. The proposed total order resolves one current challenge of EHFLTSs and thus can serve as a foundation of decision making with EHFLTSs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Bringmann2017,
abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Generally, studies of change over time have combined individuals into groups for analysis, which is inappropriate in most, if not all, studies of development. The authors explain how to identify appropriate levels of analysis (individual vs. group) and demonstrate how to estimate changes in developmental processes over time using a multivariate nonstationary time series model. They apply this model to describe the changing relationships between a biological son and father and a stepson and stepfather at the individual level. The authors also explain how to use an extended Kalman filter with iteration and smoothing estimator to capture how dynamics change over time. Finally, they suggest further applications of the multivariate nonstationary time series model and detail the next steps in the development of statistical models used to analyze individual-level data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

However, it might be inconsistent with real human thinking in some extent. In order to deal with such problems, a sample survey based MADM method with prospect theory is proposed. Firstly, through sampling survey, we collect the data in single point format corresponding to the words, and establish the codebook by mapping words into fuzzy sets, after that fuzzy operation rules are suitable for them. Secondly, based on the reference points, the gain and/or loss matrix is obtained, in accordance with the value function, the prospect value matrix is constructed. Finally, if the attributes are independent, the weighted prospect value of each alternative is computed, if the attributes are dependent, the Choquet integral based prospect value of each alternative is computed. The alternatives are ranked in descending order respect to the defuzzified values. The first alternative is chosen as the best decision result. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated through an application in online shopping problem from real life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Exploiting the opportunities provided by Web 2.0 technologies has led to the appearance of social web applications, which allow users to interact and collaborate with each other, thereby sharing experience in an online environment. Establishing a trust mechanism is vital in order to identify the trustful sources of information on the social web. Trust prediction can be a useful tool for identifying the potential trust relationships among users in an online community. Thereby, reliable participants can be recommended to users; this increases social interaction among users and makes the trust network denser. The main contribution of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of soft computing and neurofuzzy techniques within the context of trust prediction. Therefore, an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a representative of neurofuzzy techniques is compared with the widely used classification techniques including C4.5 decision tree, artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression, and Bayesian network. All methods are applied on a portion of data obtained from the Epinions network. The results of empirical experiments indicate that ANFIS achieves the best performance in terms of area under ROC (AUC) among all other methods. Furthermore, ANFIS follows closely a C4.5 algorithm concerning F-measure. Overall, the results of experiments indicate that AFNIS can be a suitable candidate for prediction of unknown trust relationships in an online community.

Some areas evidenced no improvement, such as people marking valuable property, displaying antiburglary stickers, or locking the car when parked away from home. Residents of Portland and Salem exhibited the greatest use of crime prevention measures, probably due to their active crime prevention programs. This is particularly true for Portland where some of the first programs were initiated, although its citizens also may be reacting to higher crime rates. An increasing number of citizens apparently view gun ownership as a means of protection against crime, with 60 percent of the 1982 respondents having a gun in their home -- a 4-percent increase over 1978. Persons over 65 were likely to use crime prevention measures than others, a finding consistent with previous surveys. Television appears to be the most effective media for reaching people with crime prevention information, followed by newspaper and radio. These methods were less effective with young people who were more likely to get information from radio, word-of-mouth, displays, or law enforcement agencies. Graphs illustrate survey findings.},

abstract = {Although considerable evidence shows that affective symptoms and personality traits demonstrate moderate to high relative stabilities during adolescence and early adulthood, there has been little work done to examine differential stability among these constructs or to study the manner in which the stability of these constructs is expressed. The present study used a three-year longitudinal design in an adolescent/young adult sample to examine the stability of depression symptoms, social phobia symptoms, specific phobia symptoms, neuroticism, and extraversion. When considering one-, two-, and three-year durations, anxiety and personality stabilities were generally similar and typically greater than the stability of depression. Comparison of various representations of a latent variable trait-state-occasion (TSO) model revealed that whereas the full TSO model was the best representation for depression, a trait stability model was the most parsimonious of the best-fitting models for the anxiety and personality constructs. Over three years, the percentages of variance explained by the trait component for the anxiety and personality constructs (73-84{\%}) were significantly greater than that explained by the trait component for depression (46{\%}). These findings indicate that symptoms of depression are more episodic in nature, whereas symptoms of anxiety are more similar to personality variables in their expression of stability. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

@article{Yazdi2015,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the application of statistical tools and techniques for quantitative assessment of spiritual capital (SC) based on a questionnaire survey in the organizations which undergo large-scale organizational change projects. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 65 individuals from three organizations were interviewed. The paper uses the 12 principles of transformation available to spiritual intelligence (referred to as SQ characteristics) to assess SC in a two-phase integrated algorithm of principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy clustering. Findings: The paper proposes a two-phase integrated algorithm. In the first phase, PCA is used to reduce the scores of items related to each of SQ characteristics and aggregate them into a single and unique measure. In the second phase, PCA is applied for total SQ quantification. For verification and validation, fuzzy clustering is employed along with PCA to cluster the people in the survey into different classes, which may possess different stocks of SC and rank them based on their level of SQ. The results of PCA are verified and validated by fuzzy clustering revealing the applicability and usefulness of PCA for SC quantification. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on individual judgments about their own SQ characteristics hence the results of questionnaire survey may be biased by individual personal characteristics. Future research can apply the proposed algorithm and check for its reliability using other psychometric instruments available in the field. Originality/value: The paper contributes by filling a gap in the quantitative management tools literature, in which empirical studies on validated multivariate analysis of spirituality have been scarce until now.

abstract = {Along with an increasing interest in the plasticity and role of personality across the adult lifespan comes the need for a diverse set of innovative statistical approaches to study it. With this paper, we set out to illustrate some of the possibilities and challenges in modelling age-related differences and time-related changes in personality psychology by means of dynamic panel models. To this end, we first distinguish between the study of age-related differences and time-related changes and demonstrate how the treatment of age and time as either discrete or continuous variables implies important modelling choices. Second, we present a selection of four example cases that address the topic of age moderation in diverse matters and with different objectives. Based on our cross-tabulation of age and time as discrete and continuous variables, the first two example cases represent fairly well-established models (cases A and B), whereas the remaining cases are used to illustrate current developments in the field (cases C and D). We close the paper with some final remarks on current limitation and future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology.},

As such, the FAME model is an easy to implement tool that supports a reasoning approach to market selection decisions. The model uses expert opinions regarding four factors: (1) fit of the firm's marketing mix in each market; (2) the fit of its key competitor's marketing mix in each market; (3) environmental conditions in each market; and (4) the strategic importance of each market to the firm. Application of the model algorithm is conducted for a small, Bulgarian winery's market selection decision. Ease of use is relevant for small to mid-size companies since a spreadsheet is sufficient to complete the algorithmic calculations.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) increases momentary positive emotions and the ability to make use of natural rewards in daily life. Method: Adults with a life-time history of depression and current residual depressive symptoms (mean age = 43.9 years, SD = 9.6; 75{\%} female; all Caucasian) were randomized to MBCT (n = 64) or waitlist control (CONTROL; n = 66) in a parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The Experience Sampling Method was used to measure momentary positive emotions as well as appraisal of pleasant activities in daily life during 6 days before and after the intervention. Residual depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960). Results: MBCT compared to CONTROL was associated with significant increases in appraisals of positive emotion (b* = .39) and activity pleasantness (b* = .22) as well as enhanced ability to boost momentary positive emotions by engaging in pleasant activities (b* = .08; all ps {\textless} .005). Associations remained significant when corrected for reductions in depressive symptoms or for reductions in negative emotion, rumination, and worry. In the MBCT condition, increases in positive emotion variables were associated with reduction of residual depressive symptoms (all ps {\textless} .05). Conclusions: MBCT is associated with increased experience of momentary positive emotions as well as greater appreciation of, and enhanced responsiveness to, pleasant daily-life activities. These changes were unlikely to be pure epiphenomena of decreased depression and, given the role of positive emotions in resilience against depression, may contribute to the protective effects of MBCT against depressive relapse.},

abstract = {Objectives: Fuzzy trace theory was used to examine the effect of information concerning medication benefits and side-effects on willingness to use a hypothetical medication. Methods: Participants (N = 999) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Using 3 × 5 experimental research design, each participant viewed information about medication side effects in 1 of 3 formats and information about medication benefits in 1 of 5 formats. For both side-effects and benefits, one format presented only non-numeric information and the remaining formats presented numeric information. Results: Individuals in the non-numeric side-effect condition were less likely to take the medication than those in the numeric conditions (p {\textless} 0.0001). In contrast, individuals in the non-numeric benefit condition were more likely to take the medication than those in the numeric conditions (p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that non-numeric side-effect information conveys the gist that the medication can cause harm, decreasing willingness to use the medication; whereas non-numeric benefit information has the opposite effect. Practice implications: Presenting side-effect and benefit information in non-numeric format appears to bias decision-making in opposite directions. Providing numeric information for both benefits and side-effects may enhance decision-making. However, providing numeric benefit information may decrease adherence, creating ethical dilemmas for providers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Design Sample survey comparing (a) responses to traditional survey questions asking for single numeric estimates to (b) responses to fuzzy set questions asking for boundary estimates of drug use. Setting Research facilities of a public university in a large southern California city. Participants Community residents using tobacco, alcohol, marijuana or amphetamine (n = 88). Measurements Personal interviews in which participants reported onset, frequency and daily rate of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and amphetamine use based on traditional survey questions and fuzzy set questions. Findings With the exception of marijuana use, fuzzy boundary estimates differed significantly from the traditional point estimates (P {\textless} 0.05). Median retest reliabilities for fuzzy boundary estimates were 0.96 (tobacco), 0.81 (alcohol), 0.96 (marijuana) and 0.95 (amphetamine). The degree of vagueness varied by behavior and drug, with estimates of daily rates showing greatest fuzziness and onset of use showing least fuzziness. Conclusions Participants recall more about past drug use than a single numeric estimate. All numeric estimates of drug use showed fuzzy set properties. Compared to traditional self-reports of drug use, fuzzy set representations provide a more complete and detailed description of what participants recall about past drug use.

abstract = {Single necessary (but not sufficient) conditions are critically important for business theory and practice. Without them, the outcomes cannot occur, and other conditions cannot compensate for this absence. Currently two analytical approaches are available for identifying single necessary conditions: Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), which was recently developed, and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which is a more established approach. FsQCA normally focuses on sufficient but not necessary configurations, but can also identify necessary but not sufficient conditions. This study uses NCA to analyze two examples of empirical datasets published in the Journal of Business Research that use fsQCA to identify single necessary conditions. A comparison of the results of NCA and fsQCA shows that NCA can identify more necessary conditions than fsQCA and can specify the level of the condition that is required for a given level of the outcome.

I use my 1995 "Community, Crime and Health" multilevel data set, a survey of a probability sample of 2,482 Illinois adults with linked census information on the respondent's census tract, zip code, city and county from the STF3 of the 1990 Census. Logistic regression shows that gun ownership is low in neighborhoods where a high percentage of adults are college-educated. Adjustment for individual-level race, ethnicity, sex, age, education, income, and household structure indicates that the presence of well-educated neighbors affects the likelihood of gun ownership, over and above individual characteristics. This relationship appears to be due to the normative climate, not to perceived threat, since neighborhood disorder does not significantly affect the likelihood of having a gun in the house. Previous victimization, however, is positively associated with having a gun in the household. In addition, people who are college-educated themselves are less likely to have a gun in the household.},

abstract = {Hesitancy is the most common problem in decision making, for which hesitant fuzzy set can be considered as a suitable means allowing several possible degrees for an element to a set. In this paper, we study the aggregation of the hesitancy fuzzy information. Several series of aggregation operators are proposed and the connections of them are discussed. To reflect the correlation of the aggregation arguments, two methods are proposed to determine the aggregation weight vectors. Based on the support degrees among aggregation arguments, the weight vector of decision makers are obtained more objectively. To deal with the correlation of criteria, we apply the Choquet integral to get the weights of criteria. A method is also proposed for group decision making under hesitant fuzzy environment.

abstract = {In this article, we propose a new technique to mitigate personality assessment problems and we named the technique Fuzzy Enabled Personality Assessment Technique (FePAT). Our technique extends and improves the scope and usage of the standard Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment technique. FePAT can also be applied to assess the personalities of large samples and offers great scope of comparison between individuals based on their personalities. It can easily be used in web portals to assess personalities automatically and thus offers greater ease and convenience in maintaining large personality inventories. Finally, since it is an extension of the standard MBTI, it is highly scalable. The theoretical foundation of FePAT is a mathematical model that converts the personalities into values that can be used to infer important conclusions regarding personality characteristics. Since it deals with values rather than verbal description, we can use well-known statistical methods to infer important relationships, which is not currently possible with existing techniques.

abstract = {Over 27 million people are trafficked across the world. This shocking number has prompted leaders of international government organizations to encourage national governments to reach agreements to battle traffickers and protect victims. Despite agreeing to these international treaties, experts and advocates despair that we continue to fail trafficking victims. They decry failures of governments to protect victims, prosecute traffickers, and establish mechanisms to prevent trafficking. The present study employs an innovative methodological approach, Fuzzy Set/Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), to examine reasons for governments' failures, and successes, in pursuing anti-trafficking efforts. Previous research finds that public corruption is a strong explanation of these failures. A key advantage of fsQCA is its ability to identify configurations of causal conditions as well as distinct explanations for the successes and failures in battling human trafficking. The present study finds the combination of public corruption with weak political rights is a powerful explanation of weak anti-trafficking efforts. In contrast, citizens and residents have strong rights and freedoms where governments mount successful anti-trafficking efforts. The present study suggests that leaders of international organizations should focus their efforts not only reducing public corruption, but enhancing rights. Future research will incorporate statistical analyses as well as expand this study's focus factors scholars find essential to advancing human rights.

abstract = {Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis hyperactivity and inflammation are thought to be prominent in the aetiology of depression. Although meta-analyses have confirmed this relationship, there is considerable variability in the effect sizes across studies. This could be attributed to a differential role of such biological systems in somatic versus cognitive-affective depressive symptoms which remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, most longitudinal research to date has focused on transient rather than persistent depressive symptoms. In the current study, we investigated the associations of hair cortisol and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) with the longitudinal persistence and dimensions (cognitive-affective versus somatic) of depressive symptoms over a 14-year period using Trait‐State‐Occasion (TSO) structural equation modelling. The data came from a large sample of older adults from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Depressive symptoms were assessed from wave 1 (2002–03) to wave 8 (2016–17). Hair cortisol (N = 4761) and plasma CRP (N = 5784) were measured in wave 6 (2012–13). Covariates included demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, chronic disease, and medication data. Our results revealed that higher cortisol and CRP levels were significantly associated with persistent depressive symptoms across the study period. Notably, both biomarkers exhibited stronger relationships with somatic than with cognitive-affective symptoms. The associations with somatic symptoms were also independent of relevant confounding factors. In contrast, their associations with cognitive-affective symptoms were weak after adjustment for all covariates. These distinct associations reveal the importance of considering symptom-specific effects in future studies on pathophysiological mechanisms. Ultimately, this will have the potential to advance the search for biomarkers of depression and facilitate more targeted treatments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of subgroups such as different ethnic, language, or education groups selected from among a parent population is common in health disparities research. One goal of such analyses is to examine measurement equivalence, which includes both qualitative review of the meaning of items as well as quantitative examination of different levels of factorial invariance and differential item functioning. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this essay is to review the definitions and assumptions associated with factorial invariance, placing this formulation in the context of bias, fairness, and equity. The connection between the concepts of factorial invariance and item bias (differential item functioning) using a variant of item response theory is discussed. The situations under which different forms of invariance (weak, strong, and strict) are required are discussed. METHODS: Establishing factorial invariance involves a hierarchy of levels that include tests of weak, strong, and strict invariance. Pattern (metric or weak) factorial invariance implies that the regression slopes are invariant across groups. Pattern invariance requires only invariant factor loadings. Strong factorial invariance implies that the conditional expectation of the response, given the common and specific factors, is invariant across groups. Strong factorial invariance requires that specific factor means (represented as invariant intercepts) also be identical across groups. Strict factorial invariance implies that, in addition, the conditional variance of the response, given the common and specific factors, is invariant across groups. Strict factorial invariance requires that, in addition to equal factor loadings and intercepts, the residual (specific factor plus error variable) variances are equivalent across groups. The concept of measurement invariance that is most closely aligned to that of item response theory considers the latent variable as a common factor measured by manifest variables; the specific factors can be characterized as nuisance variables. CONCLUSIONS: Invariance of factor loadings across studied groups is required for valid comparisons of scale score or latent variable means. Strong and strict invariance may be less important in the context of basic research in which group differences in specific factors are indicative of individual differences that are important for scientific exploration. However, for most applications in which the aim is to ensure fairness and equity, strict factorial invariance is required. Health disparities research often focuses on self-reported clinical outcomes such as quality of life that are not observed directly. Latent variable models such as factor analyses are central to establishing valid assessment of such outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

These methods yield multiple snapshots of people's experiences over time in daily life and allow researchers to identify patterns of behavior within a given individual, rather than strictly identify patterns of behavior across individuals, as with standard nomothetic approaches. In this article, we discuss the origin and evolution of idiographic methods in the field of personality and explain how experience sampling methods function as modern day idiographic methods in this field. We then review four primary ways in which experience sampling methods have been used to foster idiographic approaches in personality research. Specifically, we highlight approaches that examine individual differences in temporal and behavioral distributions, situation–behavior contingencies, daily processes, and the structure of daily experience. Following a brief methodology primer, we end by discussing future directions for idiographic experience sampling approaches in personality psychology and beyond.},

Previous research has primarily focused on using PPMC in model checking for unidimensional and multidimensional IRT models for dichotomous data, and has paid little attention to polytomous models. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to investigate the performance of PPMC in detecting different sources of misfit for the partial credit model family. Results showed that the PPMC method, in combination with appropriate discrepancy measures, had adequate power in detecting different sources of misfit for the partial credit model family. Global odds ratio and item total correlation exhibited specific patterns in detecting the absence of the slope parameter, whereas Yen's Q1 was found to be promising in the detection of misfit caused by the constant category intersection parameter constraint across items.},

In the present article, we combine insights from basic affective science and the biosocial theory of BPD to present a theoretical model that captures the most fundamental affective dynamical processes that underlie BPD and stipulates that individuals with BPD are characterized by more negative affective homebases, higher levels of affective variability, and lower levels of attractor strength or return to baseline. Next, we empirically validate this proposal by statistically modeling data from three electronic diary studies on emotional responses to personally relevant stimuli in personally relevant environments that were collected both from patients with BPD (N = 50, 42, and 43) and from healthy subjects (N = 50, 24, and 28). The results regarding negative affective homebases and heightened affective variabilities consistently confirmed our hypotheses across all three datasets. The findings regarding attractor strengths (i.e., return to baseline) were less consistent and of smaller magnitude. The transdiagnostic nature of our approach may help to elucidate the common and distinctive mechanisms that underlie several different disorders that are characterized by affective dysregulation.},

This theory relies on 2 decompositions: (1) the decomposition of any observed score into a latent state and a measurement error component, and (2) the decomposition of any latent state into a latent trait and a latent state residual. This conceptualizes the view that most psychological attributes have both state and trait components. Several sets of assumptions are presented which lead to different simultaneous equation models.

We set up a detailed procedure for the FIRM and apply it to a valuable empirical study with Beck Depression Inventory-II (Chinese version) administrated on outpatient diagnosed as depression was given. The results showed the correct classification of depression based on FIRM scoring was 80.3{\%} while that of raw score was only 73.2{\%}. That is, via FIRM scoring, 7.9{\%} of the erroneous judgments of depression inferred from self-reported inventory were reduced. It is also suggested that considerable cost concerning prevention and cure of depression might be reduced via FIRM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Pedestrian behavior is affected by a multitude of factors such as age, gender, and operating conditions. However, traditional statistical analysis based on observed movements or questionnaire survey is unable to model decision-making process of each pedestrian. This study develops an innovative approach based on fuzzy logic to model the underlying cognitions and behavioral patterns of pedestrians as inferred from field observation in order to evaluate age and gender effect of pedestrians in crossing a signalized crosswalk and when jaywalking. Fuzzy sets and rules are created to model the relationship between human cognitions and decisions of an individual pedestrian. Through calibrating the membership functions of different age and gender groups, behavioral patterns of pedestrians are evaluated and compared. Different from most previous studies, both older and younger pedestrians are found to be less risk-taking than adult pedestrians. Moreover, significant gender difference is found only for cognitions of most hazardous conditions. Consistent with previous studies, it is seen that men have better cognitive skills than women at detecting hazardous situations. The findings from this study are useful to better design safe pedestrian crossing facilities. The fuzzy logic-based approach also provides an innovative way to simulate pedestrian movements in microscopic simulation models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In this article, we study the size distortions of the KPSS test for stationarity when serial correlation is present and samples are small- and medium-sized. It is argued that two distinct sources of the size distortions can be identified. The first source is the finite-sample distribution of the long-run variance estimator used in the KPSS test, while the second source of the size distortions is the serial correlation not captured by the long-run variance estimator because of a too narrow choice of truncation lag parameter. When the relative importance of the two sources is studied, it is found that the size of the KPSS test can be reasonably well controlled if the finite-sample distribution of the KPSS test statistic, conditional on the time-series dimension and the truncation lag parameter, is used. Hence, finite-sample critical values, which can be applied to reduce the size distortions of the KPSS test, are supplied. When the power of the test is studied, it is found that the price paid for the increased size control is a lower raw power against a non-stationary alternative hypothesis. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, 2011.},

abstract = {Most empirical studies of emotion regulation have relied on retrospective trait measures, and have not examined the link between daily regulatory strategies and every day emotional well-being. We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n = 187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably “adaptive” cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently “good” or “bad”.},

In this paper several views on the fuzziness of concepts are pointed out to have stemmed from dubious concepts of fuzziness. The underlying notions of the roles feasibly played by prototype, set, and probability in modeling concepts strongly suggest that the controversy originates from a vague relation between intuitive and mathematical ideas in the cognitive sciences. It is argued that the application of fuzzy sets cannot resolve this vagueness since they are one sided, viz., defined on sets. An alternative definition based on classes (in the sense of axiomatic set theory) is proposed.},

The known equivalent vector autoregressive model types, standard and structural, are given a new interpretation in which they are conceived of as the extremes of an innovating type of hybrid vector autoregressive models.

abstract = {Borderline personality disorder (PD) has historically been cast as an unabating condition. Longitudinal data, however, support a more variable time course marked by remission and relapse. In the present study, we tested the possibility that borderline PD has both stable (i.e., consistently present across time and situation, as modern diagnostic systems stipulate) and dynamic (i.e., episodic and situational) elements. Participants were 668 patients from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study who were administered semistructured diagnostic interviews 5 times over a decade. Trait-state-occasion modeling dissected borderline pathology into time-invariant (i.e., trait) and time-varying (i.e., state) components. Contradicting traditional views of PD intransigence, less than half of borderline PD variability (approximately 45{\%}) was time-invariant (i.e., perfectly stable) over the study timeframe. Furthermore, we found that the time-invariant component of borderline pathology, which we termed borderline proneness, was very closely related (r = .81) to a previously validated Five Factor Model trait composite of borderline features. Moreover, the trait versus state components showed a clear pattern of discriminant validity in relation to several putative causal agents for borderline PD (i.e., environmental pathogens, temperament dimensions). We conclude that borderline pathology contains a stable core and sizable situational components, and that both elements relate systematically to normative personality dimensions and known risk factors. These findings have key implications for etiological research, prognosis, and treatment for borderline PD.},

abstract = {The independence of positive and negative affect has been heralded as a major and counterintuitive finding in the psychology of mood and emotion. Still, other findings support the older view that positive and negative fall at opposite ends of a single bipolar continuum. Independence versus bipolarity can be reconciled by considering (a) the activation dimension of affect, (b) random and systematic measurement error, and (c) how items are selected to achieve an appropriate test of bipolarity. In 3 studies of self-reported current affect, random and systematic error were controlled through multiformat measurement and confirmatory factor analysis. Valence was found to be indepen-dent of activation, positive affect the bipolar opposite of negative affect, and deactivation the bipolar opposite of activation. The dimensions underlying D. Watson, L. A. Clark, and A. Tellegen's (1988) Positive and Negative Affect schedule were accounted for by the valence and activation dimensions. A consensus on a descriptive structure of current affect is at hand—if we can only agree on what the structure is. The psychology of mood, emotion, and affect needs a consensual structure and is tantalizingly close to achieving one. Among the remaining disagreements, the most puzzling and persistent is bipolarity versus independence. Is positive affect the bipolar opposite of, or is it independent of, negative affect? Are happi-ness and sadness two ends of one continuum, or separate entities, like apples and oranges? A resolution to this puzzle is needed to answer questions about the number of dimensions of affect, how affect should be measured, and the underlying processes involved. Despite repeated attempts, a solution to this puzzle remains elusive, and a long-simmering debate has recently flared up. Much is at stake in this debate, for important lines of research have arisen on these opposing assumptions. This article offers conceptual and empirical analyses aimed at resolving the dispute.

Roles proved as predictors of current personality states albeit effects differed significantly between individuals. Life goals accounted for between‐person differences in average personality states but were not effective in predicting differences in relations between personality states and roles. Altogether, findings testify to the viability of the employed research strategy to analyse the interplay between both dispositional and fluctuating influences on individuals' trait expressions in behaviour. },

FsQCA allows researchers to estimate which of these attitudes and social values are necessary, sufficient, or both for full membership in the set of most entrepreneurial active countries within the set of GEM innovation-driven countries. FsQCA provides also valuable details that contribute to explain why, although significant, some GEM regression analyses do not usually show a high explanatory capacity.

abstract = {From a methodological point of view, the major aim of ambulatory assessment is the measurement of variability over time. If behavior and feelings did not fluctuate over time, ambulatory assessment would be a waste of money because a single measurement would be sufficient for assessing an individual's behavior or experience. However, not every fluctuation of scores over time indicates that the state of an individual really changes. Fluctuations in scores can just be due to measurement error. Because measurement errors cannot be avoided in the social and behavioral sciences, fluctuations of scores over time are at least partly due to measurement error. The crucial question then is to what degree behavior and feelings are really variable and how error-free states can be measured. Moreover, in order to detect the situational influences on behavior and experiences, the measurement of error-free, occasion-specific variables that can be related to situational characteristics is necessary. Structural equation modeling allows researchers to separate measurement error from true individual scores and is able to distinguish between variability that is due to unsystematic measurement error, and variability that reflects systematic influences of situations and time. Moreover, structural equation modeling offers the possibility to calculate coefficients that indicate the psychometric properties of measures, such as their reliability, stability, and variability. An introduction into structural equation modeling in general is given, for example, by Kline (2010) and Schumacker and Lomax (2010). In this chapter we show how structural equation modeling can be used for ambulatory assessment. We start with models for a single day. We first introduce general models of longitudinal analysis and show how these models can be adapted to the situation of individually varying times of observation. Then we extend this modeling approach to multiple days, focusing on models that are appropriate to analyze interindividual differences. Finally, we show how these models can be used to estimate scores of intraindividual variability.},

abstract = {Drawing inferences about dynamics of psychological constructs from intensive longitudinal data requires the measurement model (MM)—indicating how items relate to constructs—to be invariant across subjects and time-points. When assessing subjects in their daily life, however, there may be multiple MMs, for instance, because subjects differ in their item interpretation or because the response style of (some) subjects changes over time. The recently proposed “latent Markov factor analysis” (LMFA) evaluates (violations of) measurement invariance by classifying observations into latent “states” according to the MM underlying these observations such that MMs differ between states but are invariant within one state. However, LMFA is limited to normally distributed continuous data and estimates may be inaccurate when applying the method to ordinal data (e.g., from Likert items) with skewed responses or few response categories. To enable researchers and health professionals with ordinal data to evaluate measurement invariance, we present “latent Markov latent trait analysis” (LMLTA), which builds upon LMFA but treats responses as ordinal. Our application shows differences in MMs of adolescents' affective well-being in different social contexts, highlighting the importance of studying measurement invariance for drawing accurate inferences for psychological science and practice and for further understanding dynamics of psychological constructs.},

The current study investigated whether the cognitive strategies of dampening and positive rumination mediated the prospective association between low trait positive affect and depressive symptoms. Participants were 209 undergraduate students who participated in an eight-week online study. Depressive symptoms and trait temperament were assessed at baseline, followed by seven weekly questionnaires which assessed cognitive strategies in response to weekly events and weekly depressive symptoms. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling following the mediation approach proposed by Nezlek. Results indicated that low trait positive affect significantly predicted less positive rumination but not greater dampening in response to weekly positive events. Less positive rumination in response to weekly positive events partially mediated the association between low trait positive affect and greater depressive symptoms across the study.},

The aim of the present study was twofold: (a) replicate the factorial structure of the BPS, and (b) examine whether the BPS scores specifically capture trait boredom or are confounded by the state of participants when they complete the BPS. For this second purpose a trait-state-occasion model (TSO) was applied to BPS scores obtained at four time points over a 6-year period among a sample of community-dwelling elderly persons. Our findings showed that the factorial structure of the BPS was not replicable. They also showed that the short-version of the BPS, comprising 8 items, was the best representation of our data. Results from the TSO revealed that only 28{\%} of the variance in the BPS-8 scores were imputable to trait-boredom component. Thus, 72{\%} of this variance were due to both state-boredom (8{\%}) and measurement errors (64{\%}). The utility of this scale was discussed.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

The three membership functions, namely exponential, trapezoidal and quadratic sigmoid together with their calculation steps are discussed. Average monthly household incomes of Malaysians are used to illustrate the proposed poverty line. Three new sets of poverty lines were derived for 3 years as numerical application to the proposed membership functions. The numerical results show the flexibility of poverty lines resulted from the composition of the proposed functions. It suggests that the official poverty line for Malaysians is too low thus creating an underestimation of the extent of poverty in Malaysia.},

Adopting an experience sampling methodology (ESM), a sample of 65 participants was recruited from a local university and was followed for a study period of two weeks. Subjects were requested to assess their emotional state and the level of Facebook use several times a day using a fixed interval assessment schedule. Statistical analyses using multilevel analysis indicated that state feelings of loneliness were predictive of a subsequent increase in Facebook use. Moreover, the size of this effect varied across persons and was shown to be highly contingent upon several psychosocial traits, including gender, social insecurity, Facebook addiction and cross-situational levels of (trait) loneliness. These findings of person-dependent, emotion regulatory uses of social media services such as Facebook may be of relevance for understanding both adaptive and maladaptive uses of online technology. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed and several recommendations for future studies made.},

Gender differences emerged, indicating that some cognitive diatheses were more trait-like for girls than for boys (i.e., positive and negative cognitions on the CTI-C; self-perceived physical appearance and global self-worth on the SPPC).

The study was conducted in conjunction with the procedures of the Drug Use Forecasting system, which conducts drug tests on arrestees. Arrestees were interviewed regarding gun ownership and possession, ease of access to guns, motivation for gun use, and how they used guns. The 11 sites used in the study were relatively high-crime urban areas. Findings show that 15 percent of the sample reported carrying a gun all of the time or most of the time. This did not correlate with drug use, but did correlate with gang membership and involvement in illegal drug sales. Twenty-eight percent of the total sample reported having a gun for illegal reasons, and 98 percent of gang members reported having a gun for illegal reasons. Forty-five percent of the sample had obtained their guns through illegal means, typically from theft or an illegal purchase. A total of 55 percent stated it was easy to obtain a firearm illegally. Other data show a strong relationship between offending with guns and being victimized with a gun. Nearly 80 percent of gang members reported being shot at. Gang members were more likely to use guns in retaliation for perceived physical or psychological harm than other members of the sample. Although the data presented are preliminary, the lecturer suggests that gun ownership and use are normative in urban gang and drug-dealing subcultures. He suggests some interventions.},

abstract = {Whereas several studies have demonstrated that Core Self-Evaluations (CSE)–or one's appraisals about one's own self-worth, capabilities, and competences–relate to job outcomes, less is known about the mechanisms underlying these relationships. In the present study, we address this issue by examining the role of within- and between-person variation in CSE in the relationship between work pressure and task performance. We hypothesized that (a) work pressure relates to task performance in a curvilinear way, (b) state CSE mediates the curvilinear relationship between work pressure and task performance, and (c) the relationship between work pressure and state CSE is moderated by trait CSE. Our hypotheses were tested via a ten-day daily diary study with 55 employees in which trait CSE was measured at baseline, while work pressure, task performance, and state CSE were assessed on a daily basis. Bayesian multilevel path analysis showed that work pressure affects task performance via state CSE, with state CSE increasing as long as the employee feels that (s)he is able to handle the work pressure, while it decreases when the level of work pressure exceeds the employees' coping abilities. Moreover, we found that for people low on trait CSE, the depleting effect of work pressure via state CSE happens for low levels of work pressure, while for people high in trait CSE the depleting effect is located at high levels of work pressure. Together, our findings suggest that the impact of work pressure on task performance is driven by a complex interplay of between- and within-person differences in CSE.},

abstract = {Using a consumer survey, this study examines whether consumption values can predict green buying behavior. The examination is based on the theory of consumption values and uses the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results show that the functional value is almost always necessary but is not sufficient by itself for predicting green buying. However, three 'causal recipes' formed with the functional value are sufficient. These recipes use the emotional, conditional and social values combined individually with the functional value. Other three combinations of consumption values are also sufficient for predicting green buying. In contrast, the absence of the functional value is a sufficient condition for not green buying, as well as three other 'causal recipes'. This finding can help marketing managers develop appropriate strategies. Further, this finding supports and clarifies the role of the theory of consumption values by taking advantage of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis.

A recent innovation, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), offers one solution to this dichotomy by identifying group-level time-series models in a data-driven manner while also reliably recovering individual-level patterns of dynamic effects. GIMME is unique in that it does not assume homogeneity in processes across individuals in terms of the patterns or weights of temporal effects. However, it can be difficult to make inferences from the nuances in varied individual-level patterns. The present article introduces an algorithm that arrives at subgroups of individuals that have similar dynamic models. Importantly, the researcher does not need to decide the number of subgroups. The final models contain reliable group-, subgroup-, and individual-level patterns that enable generalizable inferences, subgroups of individu...},

While previous studies have examined the structure of emotions primarily through interindividual correlations, we investigated how often and which specific positive and negative emotions dccur together within individuals. two studies were conducted with high school students, one (N = 21,678) using restrspective emotion measures (open-ended questions and 28 rated items) and the other (N= 472) using in-the-moment emotion measures (experience sampling). As in previous studies, positive and negative emotion ratins were negatively correlated across individuals, and this negative correlation became stronger when measurement error was controlled. Nevertheless, network analyses of both the open-ended responses and of emotion rating scales found frequent co-occurrences between both positive and negative emotions within individuals and within situations. Across all networks, happy, tired, and stressed were among the most frequent emotions that occurred together with emotions of opposite valence. The network analyses presnted in ths article open new directions to the long-lasting debate about the structure of emotions by reveealing co-occurrences that interindividual correlations would not show.},

A time series of EMG data contains bursts of electrical activity that increase in magnitude when the pertinent facial muscles are activated.

We also allowed the association between EMG signals and self-reported affect ratings to vary between regimes and found that the relationship between these two markers did in fact vary over time.

abstract = {Fuzzy-set theory has provided researchers with a new perspective on many social-scientific problems. In particular, the method of fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) has gained in popularity across various disciplines. However, while the methodological development of fsQCA has progressed on a number of fronts, sensitivity diagnostics have only recently been put on the agenda. This article analyses how coverage as an important descriptive statistic in fsQCA is influenced by the interaction between membership function form and crossover threshold choice. Depending on the relative location of the latter, changes in the former influence coverage in either a negative or a positive direction, and to different magnitudes. This influence is not uniform but varies in relation to cases' distance from unique peak points. Although the orientation of this article is theoretical, its results have implications for empirical research. Most importantly, the influence of membership functions should become part of routine sensitivity checks.

The results of this study may be expressed in percentages of the total number of terms that each pair of judges assigned to identically the same columns. Taking only the instances where all three judges agree, we find 141 words or 47 per cent of the list, whereas 6.25 per cent represents the chance expectation. Examining this average agreement more closely we next determine the peculiarities of each individual judge when his placements are compared with those of the other two judges. This analysis calls attention to perhaps the principal source of unreliability, namely the tendency of each judge to have a mental set of "leniency" favoring the inclusion of marginal or doubtful terms in one column rather than another. Four outside judges selected 130 of the 300 terms as strange and unfamiliar to them. The agreement of the three editors for this group of terms averaged only 45 per cent, as against 47 per cent for the total list, and 48 per cent for the remaining 170 more familiar terms. Apparently established usage and familiarity enhances but slightly the reliability of the placement.},

The aims of this study are (a) to propose a random coefficient DFM (RC-DFM) to statistically model variations of dynamics across multiple units using the Bayesian method, (b) to illustrate the use of the proposed procedure by applying RC-DFMs to affect data collected from multiple dyads in romantic relationships, and (c) to evaluate the performance of the RC-DFMs with Bayesian estimation through simulation analyses.

abstract = {The themes are compared with official crime statistics and nationally representative survey data to determine the extent to which the media distort information on women's crime concerns and gun ownership. Data for the research were obtained from National Crime Surveys, General Social Surveys, the Uniform Crime Reports, and a content analysis of print media from 1989-93. Findings show that in the print media women's victimization is overstated, the criminal justice system is portrayed as unresponsive, and it is strongly suggested that a gun may be women's only chance for protection from criminals. This distorted view of women's victimization is disturbing for two reasons. First, by generalizing and exaggerating the picture of women's victimization, women may adopt prevention strategies that are ineffective and in some cases dangerous. Guns, for example, are not especially effective deterrents to crime, since most crimes occur in undeterrable situations. Moreover, by having a gun in the household, the chances for accidental deaths and injuries, successful suicide, and homicide increase. Second, a distorted view of crime and the criminal may result in women not being sensitized to the kinds of crime they are most likely to experience. The media most often portray the threat to women as primarily a stranger and a predator, but in fact women are most in danger from persons they know. Media distortions inhibit women's abilities to assess and understand the true nature of victimization and to develop effective prevention strategies. 5 figures and 67 references},

abstract = {Measurement error is omnipresent in psychological data. However, the vast majority of applications of autoregressive time series analyses in psychology do not take measurement error into account. Disregarding measurement error when it is present in the data results in a bias of the autoregressive parameters. We discuss two models that take measurement error into account: An autoregressive model with a white noise term (AR+WN), and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In a simulation study we compare the parameter recovery performance of these models, and compare this performance for both a Bayesian and frequentist approach. We find that overall, the AR+WN model performs better. Furthermore, we find that for realistic (i.e., small) sample sizes, psychological research would benefit from a Bayesian approach in fitting these models. Finally, we illustrate the effect of disregarding measurement error in an AR(1) model by means of an empirical application on mood data in women. We find that, depending on the person, approximately 30-50{\%} of the total variance was due to measurement error, and that disregarding this measurement error results in a substantial underestimation of the autoregressive parameters.},

abstract = {In the recent literature on knowledge-based occupations it is frequently noted that some groups, such as management consultants, have been far less successful than others in developing a system of professional regulation and organization. This is generally attributed to the functional characteristics of their knowledge base, which is too elusive, fuzzy and perishable to sustain traditional professionalization projects. It is also suggested that these groups have little interest in becoming professions and have relied instead on alternative occupational strategies. In this article, drawing on a range of secondary sources, the authors highlight certain limitations of this account and offer an alternative. Focusing on the historical development of professional associations in the context of management consulting in the UK, the authors illustrate the role played by the state and large firms in undermining efforts to professionalize. A key contribution of the article is to highlight the need for a more inclusive approach to understanding why new knowledge-based occupations have failed to professionalize, one that gives more weight to the historical context and the role played by other key actors in shaping change.

abstract = {Mixed models take the dependency between observations based on the same cluster into account by introducing 1 or more random effects. Common item response theory (IRT) models introduce latent person variables to model the dependence between responses of the same participant. Assuming a distribution for the latent variables, these IRT models are formally equivalent with nonlinear mixed models. It is shown how a variety of IRT models can be formulated as particular instances of nonlinear mixed models. The unifying framework offers the advantage that relations between different IRT models become explicit and that it is rather straightforward to see how existing IRT models can be adapted and extended. The approach is illustrated with a self-report study on anger. are a collection of statistical tools that are well suited for analyzing clustered data, such as, for example, data from students nested within schools or repeated measurement data (measurements nested within participants). Modeling clustered data under a model that assumes independent observations is inappropriate because the observations on the subunits (students, measurements) of the same unit (school, participant) tend to be more homogeneous than the observations on subunits of different units. The heterogeneity between units can be taken into account by assuming that (some of) the parameters of the model follow some random distribution over the population of units. Hence, (some of) the parameters of the model are random variables, and the model is a random effects model, or mixed model. The random effects represent the unit effects. The parameters that are not assumed to be random real-izations from a distribution, and hence are not considered to be unit specific, are called fixed effects. Mixed models and related methods were first developed in the context of analysis of variance and regression analysis, leading to the linear mixed model. Other commonly used terms are multilevel models (Goldstein, 1995), hierarchical models (Raudenbush {\&} Bryk, 2002), and random coefficient models (Long-ford, 1993). More recently, nonlinear mixed models were also developed. A nonlinear mixed model is a model with random coefficients in which the fixed and/or random effects enter the model nonlinearly (Davidian {\&} Giltinan, 1995). As we explain below, a subset of nonlinear mixed models is the class of generalized linear mixed models (McCulloch {\&} Searle, 2001). The main purpose of this article is to explain how item response theory (IRT) models can be conceptualized as nonlinear mixed models and to provide a framework for this conceptualization. There are four important assets of this approach. First, this concep-tualization relates IRT to the broad statistical literature on mixed models. Second, applying the same framework to different IRT models can help in the understanding of their differences and commonalities. Third, using this framework, one can readily adapt or extend standard IRT models, so that a researcher can build his or her own model, customized to a specific scientific question or data set. Fourth, existing and newly formulated models can be estimated using soft},

The participants completed a self-report instrument that was based on information collected in informal focus groups composed of law enforcement personnel and experts from across the State. They completed the survey approximately 90 days before the law took effect in January 1, 1996. Results revealed optimism about the law's potential to deter various types of crime and to reduce fear of crime among concealed handgun owners. However, participants also expressed concerns, which centered on perceived inadequacies in State-mandated requirements and on police safety. A majority perceived the State requirements as largely inadequate not only for instructing citizens on how to use handguns safely and legally, but also for screening out undesirable permit applicants.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Hopelessness is a common experience of patients with depressive disorders (DD) and an important predictor of suicidal behaviour. However, stability and factors explaining state and trait variation of hopelessness in patients with DD over time are poorly known. 

METHODS
Patients with DD (n = 406) from the Vantaa Depression Study and the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study filled in the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Social Support Scale–Revised (PSSS-R), and Eysenck Personality Inventory–Q (EPI-Q) at baseline, at six and eighteen months, and at five years. We conducted a multilevel linear regression analyses predicting BHS with these covariates. 

RESULTS
During the five-year follow-up half of the variance in BHS was attributable to between-patient variance (50.6{\%}, CI = 41.2–61.5{\%}), and the rest arose from within-patient variance and measurement errors. BDI and BAI explained 5.6{\%} of within-patient and 28.4{\%} of between-patient variance of BHS. High Neuroticism and low Extraversion explained 2.6{\%} of the between-patient variance of BHS. PSSS-R explained 5{\%} of between-patient variance and 1.7{\%} of within-patient variance of BHS. 

LIMITATIONS
No treatment effects were controlled. 

CONCLUSIONS
Hopelessness varies markedly over time both within and between patients with depression; it is both state- and trait-related. Concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms and low social support explain both state and trait variance, whereas high Neuroticism and low Extraversion explain only trait variance of hopelessness. These variations influence the utility of hopelessness as an indicator of suicide risk.},

abstract = {By disrupting the normally stable political agenda, "critical events" can create short-term opportunities to advance policy initiatives. However, we still know comparatively little about the conditions under which states change their laws after critical events, and whether these conditions differ from those that resulted in similar policy changes before the event occurred. I use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the determinants of state-level changes to firearm restriction in the 2011-2012 and the 2013-2014 legislative sessions. To do so, I collected original data on changes to state level firearms provisions, strength of state-level gun control and gun rights mobilization, strength of state gun culture, and other measures of state-level political context. I find that while the conditions under which states changed their firearms laws did not differ markedly before and after the shooting, the same conditions did result in far more dramatic changes to state-level firearms restrictions.

abstract = {Bias in inferences from samples constitutes one of the main sources of error in macrosociological studies. The problem is typically understood as one of “selection bias.” What constitutes the population available for selection, by contrast, is rarely thought of as being problematic. This article works to remedy this oversight and to demonstrate that this factor is not to be overlooked—suggesting that the categorization of cases constitutes another important source of biased inferences. This article argues that, because the boundaries of most macrosociological concepts are fuzzy, samples formed according to the logic of crisp-set categorization might lead to “categorization bias.” In order to avoid such a categorization bias, we argue that cases should be weighted depending on how strongly they resemble the prototypes of the categories for which one wants to arrive at generalizations. This article further argues that, by weighting for prototypicality, the logic of fuzzy boundaries of concepts and comparative and statistical methods can be combined. In the process, we provide an example of how weighting by prototypicality can be applied in the area of ethnic studies.

In each chapter, contributors not only provide a rigorous analysis of the data collected in the survey but also place the findings within the broader context of previous survey research on the topic. An introductory chapter notes that three themes characterize major aspects of public opinion about crime and justice issues over time. One is the significant temporal stability in many aspects of public attitudes, including perceptions of crime, fear of crime, evaluations of the police, the government's role in spending to fight crime, gun control, and drug control policy. A second theme is apparent logical inconsistency between views on related issues. One example is the support of a majority of Americans for capital punishment for murder because they believe it acts as a deterrent; they support capital punishment even if it can be shown it is not a deterrent. A third theme is the public's essentially pragmatic view on most issues. People favor those policies and practices they believe are effective in increasing public safety and reducing crime.

In contrast, much of applied psychology is concerned with the analysis of variation within individuals. Furthermore, the mechanisms specified by psychological theories generally operate within, rather than across, individuals. This disconnect between research practice, applied demands, and psychological theories constitutes a major threat to the conceptual integrity of the field. Following groundbreaking earlier work, we propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes within-person (WP) and between-person (BP) sources of variation in psychological constructs. By simultaneously considering both sources of variation, it is shown how to identify possible reasons for nonequivalence of BP and WP structures as well as establishing areas of convergence.

abstract = {Curran and Bollen combined two models for longitudinal panel data: the latent growth curve model and the autoregressive model. In their model, the autoregressive relationships are modeled between the observed variables. This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter $\rho$ is invariant over time and lies between −1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters. In structural equation modeling (SEM) literature, two important classes of models to analyze longitudinal panel data can be distinguished. The oldest consists of models containing autoregres-sive relations, such as the simplex model, the quasi-simplex model, the Wiener-simplex model, and the Markov model (Guttman 1954; J{\"{o}}reskog 1971, 1979; Humphreys 1960; Anderson 1960).

abstract = {In this study a new scaling method was proposed and validated, fuzzy partial credit scaling (FPCS), which combines fuzzy set theory (FST; Zadeh, 1965) with the partial credit model (PCM) for scoring the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, {\&} Brown, 1996). To achieve this, the Chinese version of the BDI-II (C-BDI-II) was administered to a clinical sample of outpatients suffering depression, and also to a nonclinical sample. Detailed FPCS procedures were illustrated and the raw score and FPCS were compared in terms of reliability and validity. The Cronbach alpha coefficient showed that the reliability of C-BDI-II was higher in FPCS than in raw score. Moreover, the analytical results showed that, via FPCS, the probability of correct classification of clinical and nonclinical was increased from 73.2{\%} to 80.3{\%}. That is, BDI scoring via FPCS achieves more accurate depression predictions than does raw score. Via FPCS, erroneous judgments regarding depression can be eliminated and medical costs associated with depression can be reduced. This study empirically showed that FST can be applied to psychological research as well as engineering. FST characterizes latent tralts or human thinking more accurately than does crisp binary logic.

The posterior predictive model-checking method is a popular Bayesian model-checking tool because it has intuitive appeal, is simple to apply, has a strong theoretical basis, and can provide graphical or numerical evidence about model misfit. An important issue with the application of the posterior predictive model-checking method is the choice of a discrepancy measure (which plays a role like that of a test statistic in traditional hypothesis tests). This article examines the performance of a number of discrepancy measures for assessing different aspects of fit of the common IRT models and makes specific recommendations about what measures are most useful in assessing model fit.

While most previous research builds fuzzy indicators by assessing a membership function as the indicator itself, with direct subjective evaluation, this new approach is based on the fuzzification of crisp indicators which are subject to imprecision, vagueness or an incomplete perception of reality. These indicators may be quantitative or qualitative yet approximate expressions from real data in order to define results and systematize the information. The evaluation process is based on those expressions and uses fuzzy distances as a performance evaluation tool to show the degree of efficacy related to both crisp and fuzzy targets set as the reference value in the evaluation process.

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to enhance scholars' understanding of work-life balance (WLB) policies in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The study explores whether SMEs display a common pattern of behavior when implementing WLB policies. The benefits of implementing WLB policies either improve conditions for the workers themselves or improve the firm's productivity. Empirical evidence on the effects of WLB, however, is scarce. This empirical study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings fail to show an association between a particular combination of factors and the implementation of WLB policies. Nevertheless, the firm's decision to implement WLB policies depends on how the firm perceives the benefits of such policies. If the firm fails to perceive organizational performance benefits, the firm will not implement WLB policies. This finding leads to two conclusions: first, potential market-based benefits represent the main factor determining whether the firm will implement WLB policies. Second, a greater degree of perceived benefits (organizational performance) makes the implementation of WLB policies more attractive to human resources managers.

Emotional resiliency is particularly relevant in old age given concomitant declines in cognitive performance. In the present study, the authors examined the dynamical linkages among positive emotion, negative emotion, and cognition as individuals performed a complex cognitive task. Comparisons were made between younger (n = 63) and older (n = 52) age groups. Older adults manifested significant unidirectional coupling from negative emotion to cognitive performance; younger adults manifested significant unidirectional coupling from negative emotion to positive emotion and from cognitive performance to both positive and negative emotions. Implications for age differences in emotion regulatory strategies are discussed.},

Results showed that adolescents had higher levels of state loneliness when they were alone, compared with being with company. When adolescents were with others, they were most lonely at school and with classmates. Adolescents showed a relief effect when they entered the company of friends after being alone, whereas a spillover effect of solitude was found when adolescents entered the company of family after being alone. Our findings show the dynamics of state loneliness, in that being with classmates increases state loneliness, whereas being with friends reduces loneliness after being alone.},

Bayesian posterior predictive model checking (PPMC) methods are increasingly being used to investigate multidimensionality in IRT models.

The proposed approach, which was termed as “PPMC assuming posterior normality” (PPMC-N), provides a straightforward method to account for parameter uncertainty in model fit assessment. A simulation study demonstrated the comparability of the PPMC-N and the Bayesian PPMC approach in the detection of local dependence in dichotomous IRT models.},

The authors show how multigroup-multiphase latent state-trait (MG-MP-LST) models can be used to examine treatment effects with regard to both mean differences and differences in state variability. The approach is illustrated based on a randomized controlled trial in which N = 338 smokers were randomly assigned to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo prior to quitting smoking. We found that post quitting, smokers in both the NRT and placebo group had significantly reduced intra-individual affect variability with respect to the affect items calm and content relative to the pre-quitting phase. This reduction in state variability did not differ between the NRT and placebo groups, indicating that quitting smoking may lead to a stabilization of individuals' affect states regardless of whether or not individuals receive NRT.},

abstract = {This study aims at implementing a simple and effective remedial learning system. Based on fuzzy inference, a remedial learning material selection system is proposed for a digital logic course. Two learning concepts of the course have been used in the proposed system: number systems and combinational logic. We conducted an experiment to validate the success of the proposed system where 88 students who studied a computer-related program at a vocational high school in Taiwan participated in the experiment. The participating students came from three different types of classes. The fuzzy expert system determined the numbers of the remedial material units according to the scores of the pre-test. Based on the results of the fuzzy expert system, each student then received personalized remedial learning materials by randomly selecting problem-based learning units from a learning material repository. After reading the remedial learning materials, the students took the post-test. The experimental results reveal that the students made significant progresses after studying the remedial learning materials. Both of high-achieving students and low-achieving students made significant progresses. Moreover, all of the three types of students made significant progresses. Lay description What is currently known about the subject matter: Remedial learning systems are helpful. Some systems are good for only low-achieving students. The remedial systems are complicated. What their paper adds to this: A fuzzy expert system has been added to produce remedial materials. Automatically select the remedial learning units according to the pre-test. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Our remedial system is good for both high-achieving and low-achieving students. Our remedial system is good for different types of students. Our remedial system is simple and easy-to-implement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Uncertainty in spatial analysis and planning has conventionally been treated as a consequence of random occurrence of exact spatial events. The present paper, however, argues that fuzziness is actually a major contributory factor to most of the uncertain spatial behavior. Exactitude in representing, analyzing, and predicting human behaviors over space and time is difficult if not impossible to accomplish in a fuzzy environment characterized by ambiguous or incomplete information and inexact cognitive and decision-making processes. Fuzzy sets theory is proposed as an appropriate framework for a formal representation and analysis of inexact spatial concepts, structures, and processes. In place of a technical presentation, the versatility of fuzzy sets theory in spatial analysis and planning is discussed from a pedagogical point of view. Applications of the theory to the conceptualization of imprecise spatial concepts, analysis of uncertain spatial behavior, and spatial decision analysis and planning are examined. Directions for further research in these areas are proposed. Compared to conventional methods, fuzzy sets approach appears to be more natural and powerful in analyzing imprecision of human spatial behaviors. Policy analysis and planning with inexact information and value-based standards can also be effectively handled. Though the development and applications of fuzzy sets theory to spatial analysis and planning has been limited and fragmentary, its potential contributions to various areas of research such as behavioral geography, cartography, remote sensing, and soft spatial data analysis are perceivable. It may prove to be a promising direction for the reconstruction of existing theories and the formulation of new theories and models of uncertainty in spatial analysis and planning.},

This paper aims at highlighting perspectives and potentials which QCA as a (relatively) new method is able to offer to address sociological research questions. In order to do so, seventy-seven publications in the field of sociology are reviewed. On this basis a broad overview is given regarding applications, trends, and developments of QCA, on the one hand. On the other, crucial steps within QCA are examined and potential pitfalls discussed by exemplifying practiced practices and best practices.

abstract = {The cumulative continuity principle of personality proposes a steady increase in Big Five trait stability across the adult life span. However, empirical support for this theoretical notion is still limited. Furthermore, the classical approach of using retest correlations might not be fully capable of illustrating the full picture of personality stability (Hertzog {\&} Nesselroade, 1987). Recent methodological and theoretical advancements suggest that individual differences in personality might reflect both absolutely stable trait-like factors and partly stable changing factors (Anusic {\&} Schimmack, 2016). Here, we aimed to compare how retest correlations versus the stable and changing factors of the Big Five personality traits change across the adult life span. Using 3 waves of personality data from Germany (N = 9,013) and another 3 waves from Australia (N = 6,012), we estimated latent retest and trait-state-occasion models in a local structural-equation-modeling framework and tested for moderating effects of age on modelspecific stability components. There were 3 main findings. First, the retest correlations indicated that inverted U-shaped patterns manifested only in part. Second, for all Big Five characteristics (except conscientiousness in Study 1), the stable trait variance was larger than the occasion-specific variance, indicating that reliable individual differences in personality are mostly due to the effects of stable factors. Third, moderating effects of age differed across the Big Five and across the 2 studies and generally showed only limited support for the cumulative continuity principle. We discuss possible theoretical and methodological implications.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the use of real-time methodologies in psychology research. The first section summarizes basic insights into how respondents answer questions and sets the stage for later sections. To date, research into the cognitive and communicative processes underlying self-reports has rarely addressed real-time (or close-in-time) measurement, which presents its own set of self-report problems. I draw attention to some of them and offer pertinent conjectures. The second section addresses reports of past behavior and reviews issues of autobiographical memory, highlighting the role of inference strategies and lay theories in determining what "must have been" (Ross, 1989). It pays particular attention to what respondents can, or cannot, report on with some accuracy. The third section turns to reports of emotions and physical symptoms. It compares prospective reports of expected future feelings and retrospective reports of past feelings, with concurrent reports of momentary experience. Of particular interest are systematic convergences and divergences between these reports. The final section turns to reports of attitudes and preferences. It reviews the promises and pitfalls of the traditional conceptualization of attitudes as enduring dispositions and notes the malleable nature of attitude reports. },

abstract = {Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are introduced to express the hesitance existing in linguistic evaluation as clearly as possible. However, most existing methods using HFLTSs simply rely on the labels or intervals of linguistic terms, which may lead to information distortion and/or loss. To avoid this problem, linguistic scale functions are employed in this paper to conduct the transformation between qualitative information and quantitative data. Moreover, the directional Hausdorff distance, which uses HFLTSs, is also proposed and the dominance relations are subsequently defined using this distance. An outranking approach, similar to the ELECTRE method, is constructed for ranking alternatives in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, and the approach is demonstrated using a numerical example related to supply chain management. Because of the inherent features of the directional Hausdorff distance and the defined dominance relations, this approach can effectively and efficiently overcome the hidden drawbacks that may hamper the use of HFLTSs. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach is further tested through sensitivity and comparative analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is often used with small to medium samples where the researcher has good case knowledge. Employing it to analyse large survey datasets, without in-depth case knowledge, raises new challenges. We present ways of addressing these challenges. We first report a single QCA result from a configurational analysis of the British National Child Development Study dataset (highest educational qualification as a set theoretic function of social class, sex and ability). We then address the robustness of our analysis by employing Dusa and Thiem's R QCA package to explore the consequences of (i) changing fuzzy set theoretic calibrations of ability, (ii) simulating errors in measuring ability and (iii) changing thresholds for assessing the quasi-sufficiency of causal configurations for educational achievement. We also consider how the analysis behaves under simulated re-sampling, using bootstrapping. The paper offers suggested methods to others wishing to use QCA with large n data.

abstract = {The theory of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is very useful in dealing with the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems in which there is hesitancy in providing linguistic assessments; and PLTSs allow experts to express their preferences on one linguistic term over another. The existing approaches associated with PLTSs are limited or highly complex in real applications. Hence, the main purpose of this paper is to establish more appropriate comparison method and develop a more efficient way to handle with MCDM problems. We first put forward a diagram method to analyze the structures of PLTSs and develop the visualized way for readers to comprehend. Then a possibility degree formula is given for ranking PLTSs. Based on the new comparison method and the theory of the fuzzy preference relation, an efficient decision-making framework is proposed to solve real-life problems under linguistic environment. Conventional TOPSIS methods combined with PLTSs are also included for comparison. All results demonstrate the practicality of the new framework. Finally, we also seek out relationship between PLTSs and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs), and compare the new formula with the similar approaches to HFLTSs' rating.

abstract = {This paper shows how the socialization process (viewed by role theorists as a “role-person merger”) can be represented and analyzed as a fuzzy (dynamical) system. Given a self-concept (a fuzzy set of roles) and social norms (logical implications from roles to actions), an individual infers actions (through approximate reasoning). Given these actions, alters make biased attributions (about the roles in the individual's self-concept) that are gradually internalized by the individual. This feedback loop creates a fuzzy ystem (a role-space vectorfield) that generates a set of stable long-run selves (role-space attractors). I illustrate this general “endogenous-self” framework with a model based loosely on Tally's Corner; the analysis examines how the individual's long-run self-concept is influenced by a constraint on employment opportunity.

abstract = {Latent state-trait (LST) and latent growth curve (LGC) models are frequently used in the analysis of longitudinal data. Although it is well-known that standard single-indicator LGC models can be analyzed within either the structural equation modeling (SEM) or multilevel (ML; hierarchical linear modeling) frameworks, few researchers realize that LST and multivariate LGC models, which use multiple indicators at each time point, can also be specified as ML models. In the present paper, we demonstrate that using the ML-SEM rather than the SL-SEM framework to estimate the parameters of these models can be practical when the study involves (1) a large number of time points, (2) individually-varying times of observation, (3) unequally spaced time intervals, and/or (4) incomplete data. Despite the practical advantages of the ML-SEM approach under these circumstances, there are also some limitations that researchers should consider. We present an application to an ecological momentary assessment study (N = 158 youths with an average of 23.49 observations of positive mood per person) using the software Mplus (Muth{\&}{\#}233;n {\&} Muth{\&}{\#}233;n, 1998-2012) and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using the ML-SEM approach to estimate the parameters of LST and multiple-indicator LGC models.},

The state also approved a bill that allows for open carry of firearms for licensed gun owners. Taken in combination, the potential for the development of a future open carry campus bill is possible. This study surveyed Texas University and College Police Officials to determine their perceptions of the perceived effects an open carry on college campus bill would have on campus crime, firearm incidents and fear of victimization among students, staff and faculty. Findings suggest that the perceived amount of crime on campus and number of firearm related incidents would remain unchanged. However, the fear of victimization of campus students and personnel would increase. Ultimately, the Texas higher education Police Officials are strongly opposed to the idea of any potential open carry bill for college campuses.

abstract = {In group decision making (GDM) with intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs), the consistency and consensus are two key issues. This paper develops a novel method for checking and improving the consistency of individual IFPRs and the consensus among experts. To measure the consistency degree of IFPRs, a consistency index is introduced and then an acceptable consistency is defined. For an IFPR with unacceptable consistency, a mathematical programming approach is developed to improve its consistency. To evaluate the consensus degree among experts, a consensus measure is presented by the proximity degree between one expert and other experts. When several individual IFPRs are unacceptable consistent or consensus is unacceptable, a goal program is built to improve the consistency and consensus simultaneously. By the consistency and proximity degrees of individual IFPRs, experts' objective weights are determined. Combining the experts' subjective weights, the experts' comprehensive weights are derived. Then, an intuitionistic fuzzy geometric weighted mean (IFGWM) operator is proposed to integrate individual IFPRs into a collective one. Moreover, an attractive property is proved that the collective IFPR is acceptable consistent if all individual IFPRs are acceptable consistent. Two examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In the network approach to psychopathology, disorders are conceptualized as networks of mutually interacting symptoms (e.g., depressed mood) and transdiagnostic factors (e.g., rumination). This suggests that it is necessary to study how symptoms dynamically interact over time in a network architecture. In the present paper, we show how such an architecture can be constructed on the basis of time-series data obtained through Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). The proposed methodology determines the parameters for the interaction between nodes in the network by estimating a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model on the data. The methodology allows combining between-subject and within-subject information in a multilevel framework. The resulting network architecture can subsequently be analyzed through network analysis techniques. In the present study, we apply the method to a set of items that assess mood-related factors. We show that the analysis generates a plausible and replicable network architecture, the structure of which is related to variables such as neuroticism; that is, for subjects who score high on neuroticism, worrying plays a more central role in the network. Implications and extensions of the methodology are discussed.},

abstract = {In recent decades, technological advances coupled with research efforts have made possible to develop very complex Decision Support Systems (DSSs) able to exhibit highly sophisticated reasoning capabilities in order to improve clinical decision-making, and, thus, promote more efficient care practices. One of the most significant factors influencing, and in particular limiting, the adoption of clinical DSSs is represented by the modality of representation and computerization of clinical guidelines in form of patient-specific recommendations. Until now, many knowledge representation formalisms have been developed, mainly focused on time-oriented guidelines. However, they can generate an unrealistic over-simplification of reality, since they are not able to completely handle uncertainty and imprecision typically affecting clinical guidelines. In this respect, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy framework expressly thought for building guideline-based DSSs, by efficiently modelling and handling the peculiarities of clinical knowledge affected by uncertainty and imprecision and encoded in the form of guidelines. This framework has been devised with the aim of: (i) offering a set of patterns for easily inserting and editing clinical recommendations belonging to a guideline as a group of one or more fuzzy rules expressing positive evidence and one fuzzy ELSE rule including negative evidence; (ii) defining a set of Fuzzy Guideline Systems (FGSs), one for each guideline encoded, characterized by ad-hoc configurations for the mathematical operators necessary to evaluate rules and generate the outcome expected; (iii) implementing a multi-level inference scheme able to treat different FGSs as a whole and efficiently enable their interconnection, i.e. the chaining among the groups of fuzzy rules belonging to each FGS; (iv) exposing a set of graphical facilities for guiding the definition of fuzzy rules to be embedded into a clinical DSS and enabling their automatic encoding and execution by using an XML-based machine executable language. A usability evaluation has been performed, showing a good satisfaction of medical users with respect to the framework implemented, and, thus, proving both its feasibility and usefulness.

abstract = {Persons with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience heightened emotional instability. Different components underlie instability, and the relation between instability and well-being could be confounded by average emotionality and within-person standard deviation across emotional states, reflecting variability. Therefore, the goal was to examine which pattern of emotion dynamics parsimoniously captures the emotional trajectories of persons with BPD. Forty persons with BPD, 38 clinical controls in a major depressive episode, and 40 healthy controls rated the intensity of their emotions 10 times a day for 1 week. After correction for differences in average emotionality, persons with BPD showed heightened emotional instability compared to both control groups. When additionally correcting for emotional variability, the authors found that instability indices did not differ between groups anymore. This shows that persons with BPD differ from control groups in the magnitude of emotional deviations from the emotional baseline, and not necessarily in the degree of abruptness of these deviations.},

abstract = {Aims: Mixed models are used increasingly for analysis of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. The variance parameters of the random effects, which indicate the degree of heterogeneity in the population of subjects, are considered usually to be homogeneous across subjects. Modeling these variances can shed light on interesting hypotheses in substance abuse research. Design: We describe how these variances can be modeled in terms of covariates to examine the covariate effects on between-subjects variation, focusing on positive and negative mood and the degree to which these moods change as a function of smoking. Setting: The data are drawn from an EMA study of adolescent smoking. Participants: Participants were 234 adolescents, either in 9th or 10th grades, who provided EMA mood reports from both random prompts and following smoking events. Measurements: We focused on two mood outcomes: measures of the subject's negative and positive affect and several covariates: gender, grade, negative mood regulation and smoking level. Findings and conclusions: Following smoking, adolescents experienced higher positive affect and lower negative affect than they did at random, non-smoking times. Our analyses also indicated an increased consistency of subjective mood responses as smoking experience increased and a diminishing of mood change. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

@article{Fuller-Tyszkiewicz2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Psychological Association. The past 2 decades have seen increasing use of experience sampling methods (ESMs) to gain insights into the daily experience of affective states (e.g., its variability, as well as antecedents and consequences of temporary shifts in affect). Much less attention has been given to methodological challenges, such as how to ensure reliability of test scores obtained using ESM. The present study demonstrates the use of dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to quantify reliability of test scores in ESM contexts, evaluates the potential impact of unreliable test scores, and seeks to identify characteristics of individuals that may account for their unreliable test scores. One hundred twenty-seven participants completed baseline measures (demographics and personality traits), followed by a 7-day ESM phase in which positive and negative state affect were measured up to 6 times per day. Analyses showed that although at the sample level, scores on these affect measures exhibited adequate levels of reliability, up to one third of participants failed to meet conventional standards of reliability. Where these low reliability estimates were not significantly associated with personality factors, they could-in some cases-be explained by model misspecification where a meaningful alternative structure was available. Despite these potential differences in factor structure across participants, subsequent modeling with and without these "unreliable" cases showed similar substantive results. Hence, the present findings suggest typical analyses based on ESM data may be robust to individual differences in data structure and/or quality. Ways to augment the DFA approach to better understand unreliable cases are discussed.},

Focus group dialogues of 17 Grade 11 multilingual students from the South Western Townships (Soweto) in Johannesburg were analysed using conversational analysis techniques from a selected data pool that was generated over a period of three hours. The results of the study show a rift between classroom language and out of school language practices. We demonstrate that (i) the Soweto youth have a wide range of linguistic flexibility that indexes the new socio-linguistic status of South Africa in the post independent era and (ii) that monolingual classroom language are no longer adequate spaces for creativity and plural identity formation. Adopting a mathematical reasoning of approximates, rather than fixed sets, we coin the concept 'fuzzy languaging logic' to argue that indigenous African languages are embedded in one another and that the respondents use this hybrid language space to identify and ethnify - choosing who they want to become beyond traditional linguistic and exact ethnic affiliations. Considerations for language in motion and social change as key features of globalization are made at the end of the article.

@incollection{Reis2012a,
abstract = {Methods for studying daily life experiences have arrived. Daily life protocols are intended to "capture life as it is lived" (Bolger, Davis, {\&} Rafaeli, 2003)—that is, to describe behavior as it occurs within its typical, spontaneous setting. By documenting the "particulars of life" (Allport, 1942), these methods provide extensively detailed data that can be used to examine the operation of social, psychological, and physiological processes within their natural contexts. A key premise of the daily life approach is that the contexts in which these processes unfold matter—in other words, that context influences behavior, and that proper understanding of behavior necessarily requires taking contextual factors into account. As the accessibility and popularity of daily life methods have increased, so too has researchers' ability grown in both range and complexity to ask and answer important questions about behavior. My goal in this chapter is to present the conceptual case for why researchers should consider adding daily life methods to their methodological toolbox. I begin by discussing the kind of information that daily life methods provide, highlighting ways in which they complement more traditional methods. Following this, the chapter reviews in turn three conceptual bases for daily life research: ecological validity, the value of field research, and the need to take context seriously. Next, I describe the role of daily life data in description and taxonomies, a step of theory building that in my opinion has been underemphasized in the behavioral sciences. The chapter concludes with a review of the place of daily life methods in research programs. An overarching goal of this chapter is to provide a context for the remainder of this handbook. My hope is that greater appreciation of why these methods are valuable for substantive research will make the what and how of subsequent chapters more compelling.},

The five indices provide somewhat different recommendations for a set of real data.

abstract = {Data were collected during January-April 1991.

Data were also collected on gun possession and carrying patterns; the number and types of firearms that juveniles possess; and where, how, and why they acquire and carry guns. Findings confirmed the prevalence of firearms in these populations, but challenged some common stereotypes concerning gun possession and use by juveniles. Findings indicate that juveniles arm themselves due to fear, rather than to the needs of criminal activity, drug trafficking, and gang affiliations. Guns, drugs, gangs, crime, and violence are all expressions of a pervasive alienation of certain inner-city youth from the conventions of larger society; the perception that firearms are necessary to survival in the inner city will endure unless attention is given to the conditions that promote insecurity and fear and that breed hostility, estrangement, futility, and hopelessness.

It is argued that the examination of carrying a gun as a dependent variable is methodologically more advantageous than using gun ownership am the dependent variable. Through use of path analysis, the direct and indirect effects on gun carrying behavior are identified. The results suggest most crime specific variables, e.g. fear of criminal victimization, do not directly influence the tendency to carry a gun, although these factors had minor indirect effects on the dependent variable. The most important direct influences on carrying a gun were age, gender, and the belief that the presence of guns is an effective deterrent to crime.

abstract = {Aimed at the difficult problems in emotion modelling, methods of artificial emotion modelling including OCC model, agent model, fuzzy logic model and so on and their application were analyzed. Then an emotion model based on EFSM was proposed, in which the variable set V was defined to offer the data for the behavior of robot. The EFSM emotion model can obtain emotional information accurately, realize the description, parametric modeling, and theoretical calculation of the emotion with multi-feature fusion. The experimental study verifies the effectiveness of the model. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology. Social Sciences Edition / Haerbin Gongye Daxue Xuebao.

abstract = {The Experience Sampling Method is a common approach in psychological research for collecting intensive longitudinal data with high ecological validity. One characteristic of ESM data is that it is often unequally spaced, because the measurement intervals within a day are deliberately varied, and measurement continues over several days. This poses a problem for discrete-time (DT) modeling approaches, which are based on the assumption that all measurements are equally spaced. Nevertheless, DT approaches such as (vector) autoregressive modeling are often used to analyze ESM data, for instance in the context of affective dynamics research. There are equivalent continuous-time (CT) models, but they are more difficult to implement. In this paper we take a pragmatic approach and evaluate the practical relevance of the violated model assumption in DT AR(1) and VAR(1) models, for the N = 1 case. We use simulated data under an ESM measurement design to investigate the bias in the parameters of interest under four different model implementations, ranging from the true CT model that accounts for all the exact measurement times, to the crudest possible DT model implementation, where even the nighttime is treated as a regular interval. An analysis of empirical affect data illustrates how the differences between DT and CT modeling can play out in practice. We find that the size and the direction of the bias in DT (V)AR models for unequally spaced ESM data depend quite strongly on the true parameter in addition to data characteristics. Our recommendation is to use CT modeling whenever possible, especially now that new software implementations have become available.},

abstract = {This research focused on the role of fuzzy expert systems, and the associated fuzzy systems theory, as a new methodology and framework for capturing and modeling important organizational judgments and decisions. It is proposed that fuzzy systems offer promise in terms of overcoming limitations in traditional policy capturing approaches. In this research effort, a judgment analysis study looking at a critical organizational decision task, managerial merit pay allocation, was conducted in which fuzzy system models were compared and contrasted with both linear and nonlinear regression models. Ten real-world managers served as participants. The results indicate that fuzzy systems are indeed a powerful tool for modeling judgments, generally outperforming both linear and nonlinear regression methods in terms of model fit. The results also yielded evidence that the managers, when completing a simulated merit pay allocation task, appeared to be using some types of nonlinear noncompensatory allocation strategies. These results imply that traditional policy capturing efforts based on linear regression may not be optimal for modeling these types of judgments. Although certain forms of nonlinear noncompensatory strategies were suggested, the exact judgment processes used by the managers could not be precisely specified due to deficiencies in both the fuzzy system and regression approaches. A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the various modeling approaches is offered, and areas for future research and development are noted.

As countries within the fragile states bracket increase around the world, competition for such assistances has also become keen. To select countries for the fragile states support facility run by the African and Asian development banks, expert ratings over sets of unquantifiable performance based criteria are used to determine the ultimate deserving countries. In order to ensure transparency and fairness in the face of competition, such multi-criteria ratings demand techniques that do not only model human judgements but take into account the effect of variations in expert ratings as a result of possible influences. This paper proposes a fuzzy TOPSIS framework for selecting fragile states for support facility based on the African Development Bank selection criteria. Using pre-defined linguistic terms parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers, a numerical example is provided on how the framework can be used by decision makers towards final selection of competing countries for the fragile states support facility. The paper anticipating possible influences of lobbyists, further performs a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect that bias in expert ratings could have on the final selection. The result shows a framework that can be applied in instances of selecting countries and organizations for aid purposes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Psychological processes are of interest in all areas of psychology, and all such processes occur within individuals over time. Some examples of psychological processes are the regulation of daily mood, the effect of job motivation on job performance and vice versa, or social interactions between a parent and child. In order to study these processes it is necessary to take many repeated measures for each individual. Multilevel autoregressive models are statistical models than can be used to analyze this kind of data - data that consist of many repeated measures, for many individuals. The approach of autoregressive models is summarized well with the saying ``The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior'': In autoregressive models, current observations are used to predict future observations. By extending the autoregressive model to a multilevel autoregressive model, it becomes possible to model the repeated measures for many individuals at the same time, while also modeling the differences between the processes of each individual. Multilevel autoregressive models are increasing in popularity within psychology, however, the methods for analyzing psychological data with these models are still being developed. The aim for this dissertation was to further investigate, explicate, and if possible remedy certain difficulties in fitting and interpreting multilevel autoregressive models in the context of psychological science. Specifically, in Chapter 1 it is discussed why it is important to collect many repeated measures for studying psychological processes, and why it is important to model these processes on an individual level, as well as the similarities and differences between the individuals' processes. In Chapter 2 a difficulty with specifying an Inverse-Wishart prior distribution for the covariance matrix of the random parameters is explored, in the context of fitting the multilevel autoregressive model in a Bayesian framework. In Chapter 3 it is discussed how to standardize the model parameters, such that we can make meaningful comparisons of the strength of the cross-lagged effects in a multivariate model. In Chapters 4 and 5 the consequences of ignoring measurement errors for the estimation of the model parameters are investigated for respectively a single-subject autoregressive model and the multilevel autoregressive model, as well as how to account for measurement errors in these models. The final chapter of this dissertation contains a summary of the work presented in the previous chapters, and a discussion of some limitations of the multilevel autoregressive modeling approach.},

Results thus obtained are considered to be generalizable to the understanding and explana- tion of variation within single cases (intraindividual variation). It is indicated, how- ever, that the direct consequences of the classical ergodic theorems for psychology and psychometrics invalidate this conjectured generalizability: only under very strict conditions—which are hardly obtained in real psychological processes–can a general- ization be made from a structure of interindividual variation to the analogous structure of intraindividual variation. Illustrations of the lack of this generalizability are given in the contexts of psychometrics, developmental psychology, and personality theory.},

We use the Dynamic Model of Activation proposed by Zautra and colleagues (Zautra, Potter, {\&} Reich, 1997) as a motivating example to construct a dynamic factor model with vector autoregressive relations and time- varying cross-regression parameters at the factor level. Using techniques drawn from the state-space literature, the model was fitted to a set of daily affect data (over 71 days) from 10 participants who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Our empirical results lend partial support and some potential refinement to the Dynamic Model of Activation with regard to how the time dependencies between positive and negative affects change over time. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed techniques when (a) changes in the time- varying parameters are represented using the true model of change, (b) supposedly time-invariant parameters are represented as time-varying, and (c) the time-varying parameters show discrete shifts that are approximated using an autoregressive model of differences. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

In each of these three test cases, I focus on the validity of fuzzy-set's claimed function—its ability to combine theoretic discourse and evidence analysis. All three studies investigate welfare state reform in the late twentieth century and apply fs/QCA: (1) 'Welfare Reform in the Nordic Countries in the 1990s: Using Fuzzy-set Theory to Assess Conformity to Ideal Types,' (2) 'States of Welfare or States of Workfare? Welfare State Restructuring in 16 Capitalist Democracies, 1985–2002,' and (3) 'The Diversity and Causality of Welfare State Reforms Explored with Fuzzy-sets.' This article begins by discussing the ontology and epistemology of comparative social policy. The fuzzy set logic and set theoretic nature of social science theory is then discussed to align the ontology with fuzzy set methodology. Next, a more detailed introduction of fuzzy-set method (fs/QCA) is followed. This study suggests that fs/QCA is a unique and useful method for comparative social policy. It advances quantitative analysis by exploring cases configurationally and also advances the qualitative analysis by applying the fuzzy set logic and the principle of calibration.

abstract = {Mathematics is associated with anxiety for many students; an emotion linked to lower well-being and poorer learning outcomes. While findings typically show females to report higher trait math anxiety than males, no gender differences have to date been found in state (i.e., momentary) math anxiety. The present diary study aimed to replicate previous findings in investigating whether levels of academic self-concept was related to this discrepancy in trait versus state anxiety measures. Additionally, mathematics-related gender stereotype endorsement (mathematics is a male domain) was investigated as an additional predictor of the trait-state discrepancy. The sample included 755 German 9th and 10th graders who completed self-report measures of trait math anxiety, math self-concept, and gender stereotype endorsement, in addition to state measures of anxiety after math classes by use of a standardized diary for 2-3 weeks (Nwithin = 6207). As expected, females reported higher trait math anxiety but no gender differences were found for state math anxiety. Also in line with our assumptions, multilevel analyses showed the discrepancy between trait and state anxiety to be negatively related to students' self-concept (i.e., a lower discrepancy for students with higher self-concepts). Furthermore, gender stereotype endorsement differentially predicted the trait-state discrepancy: When controlling for self-concept in mathematics, females who endorsed the gender stereotype of math being a male domain more strongly overestimated their trait math anxiety as compared to their state anxiety whereas this effect was not significant for males. The present findings suggest that gender stereotype endorsement plays an important role in explaining gender differences in math anxiety above and beyond academic self-concept. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Experience sampling methods (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offer insight into daily life experiences, including symptoms of mental disorders. The application of ESM/EMA in psychopharmacology can be a valuable addition to more traditional measures such as retrospective self-report questionnaires because they may help reveal the impact of psychotropic medication on patients' actual experiences. In this paper we systematically review the existing literature on the use of ESM/EMA in psychopharmacology research. To this end, we searched the PsycInfo and Medline databases for all available ESM/EMA studies on the use of psychotropic medication in patients with DSM-III-R and DSM-IV disorders. Dissertations were excluded. We included 18 studies that applied ESM/EMA to study the effects of medication on patients with major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychotic disorder, and anxiety disorder. We found that ESM/EMA may allow researchers and clinicians to track patients during different phases of treatment: before treatment to predict outcome, during treatment to examine the effects of treatment on symptoms and different aspects of daily life experience, and after treatment to detect vulnerability for relapse. Moreover, ESM/EMA can potentially help determine how long and in what contexts medications are effective. Thus, ESM/EMA may benefit both researchers and clinicians and might prove to be an effective tool for improving the treatment of psychiatric patients.},

abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) models have been widely used in educational measurement testing. When there are repeated observations available for individuals through time, a dynamic structure for the latent trait of ability needs to be incorporated into the model, to accommodate changes in ability. Other complications that often arise in such settings include a violation of the common assumption that test results are conditionally independent, given ability and item difficulty, and that test item difficulties may be partially specified, but subject to uncertainty. Focusing on time series dichotomous response data, a new class of state space models, called Dynamic Item Response (DIR) models, is proposed. The models can be applied either retrospectively to the full data or on-line, in cases where real-time prediction is needed. The models are studied through simulated examples and applied to a large collection of reading test data obtained from MetaMetrics, Inc. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

abstract = {In many applications of system state forecasting, the prediction is performed using multi-dimensional data sets. The traditional methods for dealing with multi-dimensional data sets have some shortcomings, such as a lack of nonlinear correlation modeling capability (e.g., for vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models), and an inefficient linear correlation modeling mechanism (e.g., for generic neural fuzzy systems). To tackle these problems, an evolving fuzzy neural network (eFNN) predictor is proposed in this paper to extract representative information from multi-dimensional data sets for more accurate system state forecasting. In the proposed eFNN predictor, linear correlations among multi-dimensional data sets are captured by a VARMA filter, while nonlinear correlations of the data sets are modeled by a fuzzy network scheme, whose fuzzy rules are generated adaptively using a novel evolving algorithm. The proposed predictor possesses online learning capability and can address non-stationary properties of data sets. The effectiveness of the proposed eFNN predictor is verified by simulation tests. It is also implemented for induction motor system state prognosis. Test results show that the proposed eFNN predictor can capture the dynamic properties involved in the multi-dimensional data sets effectively, and track system characteristics accurately.

Application of these models has been somewhat limited by empirical or conceptual problems. In the present study, Monte Carlo analysis revealed that TSE models tend to generate improper solutions when N is too small, when waves are too few, and when occasion factor stability is either too large or too small. Mathematical analysis of the LST-AR model revealed its limitation to constructs that become more highly auto-correlated over time.

abstract = {Most research on the link between social anxiety and alcohol consumption has examined problematic outcomes without consideration of potential adaptive functions. Alcohol is an anxiolytic that has the short-term benefit of reducing anxiety; consumption may act as a social lubricant that facilitates higher quality social interactions. Using experience-sampling methodology, we examined how consuming alcohol attenuates the adverse effects of social anxiety in naturally occurring social interactions. Participants (N = 160) completed demographic and trait measures, then completed daily assessments for 14 consecutive days. Results from multilevel model analyses revealed that during face-to-face social interactions, state social anxiety was inversely related to 10 indicators of healthy social interactions (e.g., enjoyment, laughter, feelings of acceptance). Alcohol consumption moderated seven of these associations, such that when participants consumed alcohol in social situations, state social anxiety was no longer associated with social interaction quality. The quantity of alcoholic drinks consumed moderated two of these associations. Furthermore, we found evidence for directionality, such that social anxiety in a given social interaction predicted alcohol consumption in a subsequent social interaction, but not the reverse (i.e., alcohol consumption did not prospectively predict state social anxiety). In social situations that involved alcohol, experiences of social anxiety no longer thwarted one's ability to derive social benefits. These results should be interpreted in the context of a participant sample with relatively low levels of trait social anxiety and frequency of alcohol use. Nonetheless, obtaining social rewards may be a reinforcement mechanism that maintains the link between social anxiety and alcohol consumption.},

Let s1 be the number of latent roots of R which are greater than or equal to unity. Then it is proved here that r ≧s1. Two further lower bounds to r are also established that are better than s1. Simple computing procedures are shown for all three lower bounds that avoid any calculations of latent roots. It is proved further that there are many cases where the rank of all diagonal-free submatrices in R is small, but the minimum rank r for a Gramian G is nevertheless very large compared with n. Heuristic criteria are given for testing the hypothesis that a finite r exists for the infinite universe of content from which the sample of n observed variables is selected; in many cases, the Spearman-Thurstone type of multiple common-factor structure cannot hold. {\textcopyright} 1954 Psychometric Society.},

abstract = {The fuzzy logic model of perception (FLMP) is analyzed from a measurement-theoretic perspective. FLMP has an impressive history of fitting factorial data, suggesting that its probabilistic form is valid. The authors raise questions about the underlying processing assumptions of FLMP. Although FLMP parameters are interpreted as fuzzy logic truth values, the authors demonstrate that for several factorial designs widely used in choice experiments, most desirable fuzzy truth value properties fail to hold under permissible rescalings, suggesting that the fuzzy logic interpretation may be unwarranted. The authors show that FLMP's choice rule is equivalent to a version of G. Rasch's (1960) item response theory model, and the nature of FLMP measurement scales is transparent when stated in this form. Statistical inference theory exists for the Rasch model and its equivalent forms. In fact, FLMP can be reparameterized as a simple 2-category logit model, thereby facilitating interpretation of its measurement scales and allowing access to commercially available software for performing statistical inference.

abstract = {States that over the past decade investigators have attempted to decompose variance in measures simultaneously into trait and state variance, and that there are currently two major approaches—the latent state–trait (LST) model as suggested by Steyer and colleagues, and the authors' own stable trait (ST), autoregressive trait (ART or AR), and state (S), or STARTS model (previously called the "trait–state–error model"). Both models partition variance in longitudinal data into trait and state components. In this chapter, the authors focus on these two models. Additionally, they show that the multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM; Campbell and Fiske, 1959) is relevant for the analysis of the matrix suggested by Kenny and Campbell (1989), that a preliminary MTMM analysis is helpful in determining how to proceed in the analysis of stability. These different models are evaluated in terms of the criteria: design, model conceptualization, model assumption plausibility, and estimation methods and difficulty. They illustrate each model's strengths and weakness through analysis of a secondary data set collected from 433 female adolescents measured 4 times at 6-mo intervals on the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale.},

abstract = {Linear dynamical system theory is a broad theoretical framework that has been applied in various research areas such as engineering, econometrics and recently in psychology. It quantifies the relations between observed inputs and outputs that are connected through a set of latent state variables. State space models are used to investigate the dynamical properties of these latent quantities. These models are especially of interest in the study of emotion dynamics, with the system representing the evolving emotion components of an individual. However, for simultaneous modeling of individual and population differences, a hierarchical extension of the basic state space model is necessary. Therefore, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model with random effects for the system parameters. Further, we apply our model to data that were collected using the Oregon adolescent interaction task: 66 normal and 67 depressed adolescents engaged in a conflict-oriented interaction with their parents and second-to-second physiological and behavioral measures were obtained. System parameters in normal and depressed adolescents were compared, which led to interesting discussions in the light of findings in recent literature on the links between cardiovascular processes, emotion dynamics and depression.

abstract = {Latent state–trait models are valuable tools for representing the longitudinal stability and variability of individuals' relative standing on a construct (e.g., a behavior or psychological process). Specifically, state–trait models partition construct variance into time-varying and time-invariant components, enabling one to examine the relations between these components and other variables. Such partitioning of construct variance has a number of valuable applications including the improvement of risk-outcome research. The trait–state–occasion (TSO) model and latent state–trait model with autoregression (LST–AR) are ideal for use with constructs with relative stability that decreases with increasing durations, but relative stability that does not decrease to 0 even over long durations. Despite the fact that this pattern of relative stability expression is observed for a wide variety of constructs, there are relatively few applications of the TSO and LST–AR models. Thus, this article describes the TSO and LST–AR models and illustrates application of these models.},

Rather than attempting to reduce the state–trait distinction to a single dimension, the author proposes 4 overlapping but distinct dimensions as underlying current professional uses of the distinction: duration, continuous vs reactive manifestation, concreteness vs abstractness, and situational causality vs personal causality. Parallels are drawn between these dimensions and aspects of the broader concepts of occurrence and disposition, and the concepts of state and trait are described as applications in psychology of these broader concepts. It is argued that a clearer understanding of the concepts of state and trait will facilitate theory and research. },

Ironically, relying on precise representations in reasoning promotes greater risk taking, but this reliance declines as adolescents mature. This phenomenon is known as a developmental reversal; it is called a reversal because it violates traditional developmental expectations of greater cognitive complexity with maturation. Fuzzy-trace theory (FTT) predicts reversals by proposing two types of mental representation (gist and verbatim), and that risk takers rely more on verbatim processing when making decisions. In this article, we describe the main tenets of FTT and explain how it can account for risky decision making. We also explore the neural underpinnings of development and decision making in the context of distinctions from FTT. FTT's predictions elucidate unanswered questions about risk taking, providing directions for research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Structured interviews and questionnaires are important tools to screen for major depressive disorder. Recent research suggests that, in addition to studying the mean level of total scores, researchers should focus on the dynamic relations among depressive symptoms as they unfold over time. Using network analysis, this paper is the first to investigate these patterns of short-term (i.e. session to session) dynamics for a widely used psychological questionnaire for depression - the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). METHOD With the newly developed vector autoregressive (VAR) multilevel method we estimated the network of symptom dynamics that characterizes the BDI-II, based on repeated administrations of the questionnaire to a group of depressed individuals who participated in a treatment study of an average of 14 weekly assessments. Also the centrality of symptoms and the community structure of the network were examined. RESULTS The analysis showed that all BDI-II symptoms are directly or indirectly connected through patterns of temporal influence. In addition, these influences are mutually reinforcing, 'loss of pleasure' being the most central item in the network. Community analyses indicated that the dynamic structure of the BDI-II involves two clusters, which is consistent with earlier psychometric analyses. CONCLUSION The network approach expands the range of depression research, making it possible to investigate the dynamic architecture of depression and opening up a whole new range of questions and analyses. Regarding clinical practice, network analyses may be used to indicate which symptoms should be targeted, and in this sense may help in setting up treatment strategies.},

@article{Janson2017,
abstract = {Background: Psychosocial stress represents an unavoidable and often long-lasting burden over the lifespan. While chronic exposure to stress is considered as antecedent of stress-related disease, designing interventions to promote healthy coping behavior requires a better understanding about the role of individual coping styles as well as the efficiency of state-dependent coping responses with regard to cortisol and alpha amylase recovery from acute psychosocial stress.

Methods: In order to evaluate the differential stress-buffering effect of coping measures, fifty-nine healthy adults (59.3{\%} female, Mage = 22.93 years) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and provided saliva samples before and repeatedly after stress. Coping patterns were obtained using trait and state coping questionnaires (SVF 78, SVF ak-42).

Results: Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test for relationships between coping measures and endocrine activity. Independent of sex, age, BMI, chronic stress, and depressiveness, cortisol recovery was predicted by state-dependent distraction coping (slope: $\beta$ = −0.0430, SE = 0.0184, p = 0.02), while alpha amylase recovery, on the contrary, was determined by defensive (slope: $\beta$ = −0.0233, SE = 0.0096, p = 0.02) and resigning coping styles (slope: $\beta$ = −0.0214, SE = 0.0093, p = 0.03).

Conclusions: The results reveal state coping as determinants of better cortisol recovery as well as coping styles as determinants of better alpha amylase recovery from psychosocial stress. To provide further evidence of this assumed health-promoting effect of coping, future investigations linking coping and inflammatory processes should shed further light on the relationship between cognitive coping and health.},

abstract = {Media reports consistently point to a substantial increase in handgun ownership among American women during the 1980s and have attributed the rise to crime fears. As well, they have suggested that the profile of women gun owners has been changing in recent years; women handgun owners now are alleged to be more urban, more middle class, and more professional than in prior years. To examine these claims, findings from available literature and data from the General Social Surveys (GSS), 1973-1991, are used to analyze the trends, patterns, and predictors of female (and male) handgun ownership in the United States throughout the past two decades. Results indicate that the proportion of women--and men--owning guns was effectively constant throughout the years in question; women's gun ownership is no more closely related to fear of crime or experiences with crime than is men's, and, for women, the relation between fear of crime and gun ownership has not changed in recent years; and the demographic predictors of female gun ownership differ little from those of males. In short, the female gun owner has not come to approximate the portraiture of the upscale, affluent, single "woman about town" depicted in the popular literature. Our attempt to explain this finding rests in part on our belief that the media have been misled by problematic interpretation of gun industry data on ownership trends.

However, the findings indicated that aggression can more parsimoniously be conceptualized as a "somewhat stable" trait with strong short-term correlations that gradually decrease at increasing intervals. Aggression was significantly dyadic. Men and women's aggression were consistently associated with one another across time beginning at engagement, with little evidence that one person's aggression evoked aggression in the partner in the time intervals studied. Consistency in a person's reporting of aggression, not shared with the partner, was strongest for self-reports.},

abstract = {Using the 2006 round of the British Household Panel Study dataset, I explore the statistical behavior of three fuzzy measures of poverty through a simulation (Monte Carlo) method. The measures totally fuzzy (TF), totally fuzzy and relative (TFR), and integrated fuzzy and relative (IFR)] acknowledge that (1) poverty is a multidimensional concept, and (2) the 'poor' and 'non-poor' are not two mutually exclusive sets and the distinction can be 'fuzzy'. I find that the sampling distributions of the fuzzy measures are quite normally distributed, and they are robust to arbitrary choice in the estimation as well as reliable with relatively small sample size, though there is some differences between the methods. Also, I show that they are robust to measurement errors: allowing random measurement errors in all indicators, the measures still yield strongly reliable results. Finally, I investigate the identification performance of each measure and show that IFR measure has strong consistency, while both TF and TFR measures significantly underestimate the number of people whose fuzzy index values are very high.

abstract = {Despite over two decades of scholarship and a plethora of studies, research focusing on the correlates of handgun ownership among subpopulation groups, especially Blacks, is lacking. In this study, data on Blacks from the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey are used to study the effects of criminal victimization, fear of crime, gender, and region on handgun ownership. The study concludes that there are significant differences in the determinants of handgun ownership among Blacks. Among the victims and nonvictims of crime, the results showed that fear of crime does not predict handgun ownership. Marital status was successful in predicting gun ownership among nonvictims of crime but not among victims. Similarly, respondent's income was significant in predicting gun ownership only among crime victims. For both groups, age and size of place are significant predictors of gun ownership. For Black males, criminal victimization, age, size of place, and income had significant effects on gun ownership. The best predictors of gun ownership for females are marital status and size of place.

abstract = {Sustainable decision-making involves political decisions at the local, regional, or national levels, which aim at a balanced development of socio–environmental systems. A fundamental question in sustainable decision-making is that of defining and measuring sustainable development. Many methods have been proposed to assess sustainability. Recently, a model has been developed, called Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation (SAFE), which uses fuzzy logic reasoning and basic indicators of environmental integrity, economic efficiency, and social welfare, and derives measures of human (HUMS), ecological (ECOS), and overall sustainability (OSUS). In this article, we perform sensitivity analysis of the SAFE model to identify the most important factors contributing to sustainable development. About 80 different indicators are tested and classified as promoting, impeding, or having no effect on the progress toward sustainable development. The proposed method is applied to the Greek and American economies. The conclusion is that there is no unique sustainable path and, accordingly, policy makers should choose different criteria and strategies to make efficient sustainable decisions for each country.},

abstract = {Based only on the characteristics of the weapons, the long guns likeliest to be substituted for handguns for either defensive or criminal purposes are about 3 or 4 times as deadly as the handguns currently used in assaults; they are also more accurate. Although it is difficult to assess, the circumstances in which homicides occur would easily permit long guns to be substituted in about 50 to 80 percent of the cases. Since many long guns would be no more expensive than black-market handguns under handgun control, cost would not be much of a deterrent to substitution. If handguns were restricted and long guns left relatively unrestricted, there would seem to be no reason why the majority of violence-prone handgun owners and would-be owners would not substitute long guns. Among defensive owners, fear would be ample motivation to substitute, while among criminal owners, the desire to continue their criminal careers and the advantages of having a firearm would encourage substitution. A handgun-only control policy would save lives only if fewer than 31.8 percent of the violence-prone handgun owners and would-be owners substituted long guns. Based on the analysis of the reasons for firearms ownership, this low percentage seems highly unlikely. A well-enforced permissive licensing system (which has never been attempted) would grant firearms licenses to all adults who wanted them, except those who had been convicted of a violent crime within the past 7 years.

The aim of the current simulation study is to examine the performance of an LGM with a continuous distal outcome under maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian estimation with default and informative priors, under varying sample sizes, effect sizes and slope variance values. We conclude that caution is needed when predicting a distal outcome from an LGM when the: (1) sample size is small; and (2) amount of variation around the latent slope is small, even with a large sample size. We recommend against the use of ML and Bayesian estimation with Mplus default priors in these situations to avoid severely biased estimates. Recommendations for substantive researchers working with LGMs with distal outcomes are provided based on the simulation results.},

DSEM is suitable for analyzing intensive longitudinal data where observations from multiple individuals are collected at many points in time. The modeling framework encompasses previously published DSEM models and is a comprehensive attempt to combine time-series modeling with structural equation modeling. DSEM is estimated with Bayesian methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis–Hastings sampler. We provide a detailed description of the estimation algorithm as implemented in the Mplus software package. DSEM can be used for longitudinal analysis of any duration and with any number of observations across time. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the framework and study the performance of the estimation method. Methods for evaluating model fit are also discussed.},

abstract = {Rough set theory has been extensively discussed in machine learning and pattern recognition. It provides us another important theoretical tool for feature selection. In this paper, we construct a novel rough set model for feature subset selection. First, we define the fuzzy decision of a sample by using the concept of fuzzy neighborhood. A parameterized fuzzy relation is introduced to characterize fuzzy information granules for analysis of real-valued data. Then, we use the relationship between fuzzy neighborhood and fuzzy decision to construct a new rough set model: fuzzy neighborhood rough set model. Based on this model, the definitions of upper and lower approximation, boundary region and positive region are given, and the effects of parameters on these concepts are discussed. To make the new model tolerate noises in data, we introduce a variable-precision fuzzy neighborhood rough set model. This model can decrease the possibility that a sample is classified into a wrong category. Finally, we define the dependency between fuzzy decision and condition attributes and employ the dependency to evaluate the significance of a candidate feature, using which a greedy feature subset selection algorithm is designed. The proposed algorithm is compared with some classical algorithms. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm gets higher classification performance and the numbers of selected features are relatively small.

abstract = {To build a science of the person, the most basic question was, and remains, how can one identify and understand the psychological invariance that distinctively characterizes an individual and that underlies the variations in the thoughts, feelings, and actions that occur across contexts and over time? This question proved particularly difficult because of the discrepancies that soon emerged between the expressions of consistency that were expected and those that were found. The resulting dilemma became known as the classic “personality paradox”: How can we reconcile our intuitions—and theories—about the invariance and stability of personality with the equally compelling empirical evidence for the variability of the person's behavior across diverse situations? Which is right: the intuitions or the research findings? In this chapter I review and discuss some of the advances made to answer this question since it was posed. These findings have allowed a resolution of the paradox, and provide the outlines for ...},

abstract = {Traits and states are concepts that people use to both describe and understand themselves and others. We show that people view these concepts as prototype-based categories that have a graded internal structure and fuzzy boundaries and identify a set of attributes that define the prototypical cores of two categories: traits and states. Prototypical traits are stable, long-lasting, and internally caused. Prototypical states are temporary, brief, and caused by external circumstances. These prototypes are not defined by averages, as the family-resemblance principle would suggest, but by ideal (or extreme) attribute values. Like other ideal-based categories, traits and states serve particular goals. Trait concepts permit people to predict the present from the past; state concepts identify those behaviors that can be controlled by manipulating the situation. These two complementary schemas are part of the extensive theory of psychological causality that is implicit in language. Abstract social concepts differ from object categories in their category standards, the nature of their attributes, and the interrelations among those attributes.},

The main purpose of our study was to find an appropriate fuzzy measure for QOL that, while demonstrating the advantages of FST, can also be compared with mainstream QOL measures, most of which use traditional Likert-type scales. Methods: Referring to the literature on fuzzy scoring methods, we first revised the measurement scale and scoring method of the traditional WHOQOL-BREF (i.e., a five-point Likert-type scale) to create three versions of a fuzzy WHOQOL-BREF. Then, we examined the psychometric relationships of these three fuzzy measures and the traditional WHOQOL-BREF in a within-subject design. Results: Our results show that a fuzzy-scales weighted-by-membership (FSWM) version of the WHOQOL-BREF is comparable to the traditional WHOQOL-BREF in that it accepts strong invariance and shows almost perfect agreement. It also demonstrates higher reliability and face validity than the traditional WHOQOL-BREF. Conclusion: We recommend that future studies examine the use of FSWM to measure QOL.

Then, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to rank the contractors. The results show financial stability, technical capacity and experience are the most important criteria for contractor selection.

abstract = {This study applies fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to the debate on links between resource scarcity and armed conflict. Previous studies on this relationship have reached contradictory results. This study aims to solve this contradiction by arguing that social, economic, and political conditions play an important role in determining whether armed conflict erupts over resource scarcity. I test three theoretic hypotheses, focusing on weak states, economic situations of households, and human ingenuity. I compare fifteen resource scarce cases with conflict to sixteen cases without armed conflict. My analysis supports the hypothesis that the economic situation of households and the levels of human ingenuity matter. In particular, the impact of high dependence on agriculture and low levels of tertiary education on the link between resource scarcity and conflict is discussed. While employing an fsQCA proves a valuable step in accounting for contradictory results, limits of the methods are apparent as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Latent state–trait (LST) analysis is frequently applied in psychological research to determine the degree to which observed scores reflect stable person-specific effects, effects of situations and/or person–situation interactions, and random measurement error. Most LST applications use multiple repeatedly measured observed variables as indicators of latent trait and latent state residual factors. In practice, such indicators often show shared indicator-specific (or method) variance over time. In this article, the authors compare 4 approaches to account for such method effects in LST models and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach based on theoretical considerations, simulations, and applications to actual data sets. The simulation study revealed that the LST model with indicator-specific traits (Eid, 1996) and the LST model with M − 1 correlated method factors (Eid, Schneider, {\&} Schwenkmezger, 1999) performed well, whereas the model with M orthogonal method factors used in the early work of Steyer, Ferring, and Schmitt (1992) and the correlated uniqueness approach (Kenny, 1976) showed limitations under conditions of either low or high method-specificity. Recommendations for the choice of an appropriate model are provided.},

abstract = {Nonrecursive models which have been used to assess the potentially reciprocal relationship between fear of crime and handgun ownership may suffer on two accounts: (a) the use of "weak" instrumental variables; and (b) the measurement of household (versus personal) handgun ownership. Data from the 1980 NORC General Social Survey are used in this study to minimize these problems in examining the relationships among fear of crime, victimization, and protective handgun ownership among males and females. Significant effects of fear and victimization on personal gun ownership are found among men but not among women. These results are discussed in light of two concerns. First, earlier research is confirmed that finds gender differences in the factors influencing gun ownership. Second, a clear need is emphasized for further research addressing questions of both conceptualization and measurement in the study of fear of crime and its effects on protective handgun ownership.

abstract = {In depression research, symptoms are routinely assessed via rating scales and added to construct sum-scores. These scores are used as a proxy for depression severity in cross-sectional research, and differences in sum-scores over time are taken to reflect changes in an underlying depression construct. To allow for such interpretations, rating scales must (a) measure a single construct, and (b) measure that construct in the same way across time. These requirements are referred to as unidimensionality and measurement invariance. We investigated these 2 requirements in 2 large prospective studies (combined n = 3,509) in which overall depression levels decrease, examining 4 common depression rating scales (1 self-report, 3 clinician-report) with different time intervals between assessments (between 6 weeks and 2 years). A consistent pattern of results emerged. For all instruments, neither unidimensionality nor measurement invariance appeared remotely tenable. At least 3 factors were required to describe each scale, and the factor structure changed over time. Typically, the structure became less multifactorial as depression severity decreased (without however reaching unidimensionality). The decrease in the sum-scores was accompanied by an increase in the variances of the sum-scores, and increases in internal consistency. These findings challenge the common interpretation of sum-scores and their changes as reflecting 1 underlying construct. The violations of common measurement requirements are sufficiently severe to suggest alternative interpretations of depression sum-scores as formative instead of reflective measures. We discuss the possible causes of these violations such as response shift bias, restriction of range, and regression to the mean.},

abstract = {Using longitudinal data from nearly 4,000 students across 113 public schools in Kentucky, we attempt to unravel the direction of the relationships between student weapon carrying and various objective and subjective school-crime experiences, including victimization, perceived risk of school victimization, and fear of school victimization. Overall, we found little support for the idea that fear and victimization increase weapon carrying, controlling for other theoretically important predictors, including delinquent offending. While 7th-grade victimization was modestly associated with increased non-gun weapon carrying in 8th grade, high perceptions of individual victimization risk in 7th grade decreased both subsequent gun and non-gun weapon carrying. Fear of criminal victimization in 7th grade did not predict either type of subsequent (8th-grade) weapon carrying. Though fear, risk, and victimization were inconsistent predictors of gun and non-gun weapon carrying, we found strong and consistent support for the effects of weapon carrying on subsequent fear, risk, victimization, and offending. However, contrary to the implications of fear and victimization hypotheses, both gun carrying and non-gun weapon carrying in the 8th grade increased fear of school crime, perceived risk, and actual victimization in the 9th grade. Implications of these findings for the applicability of a “weapons” or “triggering” effect are discussed.

The exporter's optimal strategy for a given importer is derived from a fuzzy set of countries in the import region that are important to the exporter and several fuzzy sets representing the exporter's utilities for its arms options. The tests conducted show the model to have considerable promise. Its predictive accuracy exceeds the success rates of two null models; it captures the policymaking for different transfer strategies; and it applies to importers in several regions. The model also outperforms a comparable expected-utility model, which is especially significant given the differences between the fuzzy and expected-utility approaches on the subject of decision-making imprecision.},

@article{Naragon-Gainey2013,
abstract = {A large body of research has found robust associations between dimensions of temperament (e.g., neuroticism, extraversion) and the mood and anxiety disorders. However, mood-state distortion (i.e., the tendency for current mood state to bias ratings of temperament) likely confounds these associations, rendering their interpretation and validity unclear. This issue is of particular relevance to clinical populations who experience elevated levels of general distress. The current study used the "trait-state-occasion" latent variable model (D. A. Cole, N. C. Martin, {\&} J. H. Steiger, 2005) to separate the stable components of temperament from transient, situational influences such as current mood state. We examined the predictive power of the time-invariant components of temperament on the course of depression and social phobia in a large, treatment-seeking sample with mood and/or anxiety disorders (N=826). Participants were assessed 3 times over the course of 1 year, using interview and self-report measures; most participants received treatment during this time. Results indicated that both neuroticism/behavioral inhibition (N/BI) and behavioral activation/positive affect (BA/P) consisted largely of stable, time-invariant variance (57{\%} to 78{\%} of total variance). Furthermore, the time-invariant components of N/BI and BA/P were uniquely and incrementally predictive of change in depression and social phobia, adjusting for initial symptom levels. These results suggest that the removal of state variance bolsters the effect of temperament on psychopathology among clinically distressed individuals. Implications for temperament-psychopathology models, psychopathology assessment, and the stability of traits are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Psychological Association.},

@article{Adams1996,
abstract = {The results of the 1995 NOSCJ are consistent with other surveys regarding the prevalence of gun ownership, the characteristics of gun owners, and opinions about gun control. Approximately one-fifth of U.S. households owned guns for protection against crime. In general, citizens preferred either more restrictions on firearms or maintaining the status quo. Although only a small minority wanted less strict gun laws, the proportion appears to have increased over time. The characteristics of respondents who wanted freer access to guns and who viewed guns as important for self-defense were similar. Americans tended to support the notion that an armed citizenry is the best defense against crime. In contrast, they generally rejected gun ownership as a means of protection against government abuse of power. Gun owners, particularly those who own guns for protection against crime, and activists were much more likely to view guns as important for protecting life and property from criminals or an abusive government. Regarding liability for the misuse of firearms, support was moderate for holding parents criminally responsible for the actions of their children, and no consensus emerged on holding manufacturers liable for injuries inflicted by guns. Finally, confidence in police, rather than fear of crime, was an important correlate of attitudes toward gun issues. Findings suggest that the successful implementation of gun regulations, which is frustrated by the perceived utility of personal gun ownership, can be promoted by increasing the public's confidence in the criminal justice system. 5 tables},

abstract = {Those who view gun violence as a serious problem cite the high number of deaths from gunshot wounds, escalating rates of gun-related homicides, and the pervasiveness of guns in households. Most gunshot victims are young males without medical insurance, many of them are under 20 years of age. Studies are cited to show that gun availability is related to an increase in the murder rate, especially among young adults, and that gun control can protect persons who are the most victimized, such as women and children. The second amendment does not prohibit the government from regulating a citizen's right to own a gun, and individual rights are often restricted for the good of collective safety. Those who do not view gun violence as a serious problem argue that the problem is exaggerated, that guns can prevent violence, that guns should not be blamed for violence, and that the public's fear of violent crime is excessive. These individuals also contend that controlling legal gun ownership does not reduce crime, that increased gun control will result in more burglaries, and that domestic violence gun control laws hinder crime reduction. In addition, they believe that gun control is not constitutional in accordance with the second amendment. The effectiveness of gun ownership as a means of self-defense is assessed. Measures to reduce gun violence are discussed, including increased awareness of violent crime, spiritual involvement, controlling gun manufacturers, holding gun manufacturers accountable, treating gun violence as a public health issue, and promoting responsible gun ownership.

These criticisms also assume that conceptual combination and logical rules (all in the Aristotelian sense) are the appropriate criteria for the adequacy of the above "fuzzy typicality". The present paper discusses these assumptions following the line of their most explicit and most influential expression by Osheron and Smith (1981). Several arguments are made against the above identification, the most important being that representativeness in prototype theory is exclusively based on element-to-element similarity while fuzzy membership is inherently an element-to-category relationship. Also the above criteria for adequacy are criticized from the viewpoint of both prototype theory and fuzzy-set theory as well as from that of both conceptual and logical combination, and also from that of integration.},

abstract = {Fuzzy trace theory posits that during development the use of verbatim information for solving transitive relationships shifts to the use of gist information. In cognitive developmental research that uses a cross-sectional design, the binomial mixture model is often used to identify such shifts. Because the binomial mixture model assumes equal task difficulty and uses the number of correctly solved tasks for data analysis, it may be too restrictive and the more flexible latent class model is adopted as an alternative. This model allows varying task difficulty and uses the pattern of task scores as input for data analysis. The binomial mixture model and the latent class model are compared theoretically, and applied to transitive reasoning test data obtained from a cross-sectional sample of 615 children. The latent class model is found to be more appropriate for identifying multiple phases. Three phases are distinguished which can be interpreted well by means of fuzzy trace theory. These phases do not encompass fixed age periods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Kleck1982,
abstract = {Previous studies indicate that many gun owners, and most handgun owners, own their weapons for defensive and protective reasons, that fear of crime and prior victimization are related to gun ownership, and crime rates are positively associated with levels of gun ownership. The 1968-78 period saw an 85 percent increase in available gun stock and a 52 percent increase in the UCR crime index rate. However, much of the increase in handgun ownership can be attributed to fear of crime rather than actual crime increases. The models used in this study considered several variables, including homicide rates, total firearms ownership, longgun and handgun ownership, new handguns added to the existing stock, UCR percentage of murders and non-negligent manslaughters known to police cleared by arrest, robbery rates, median family income in 1974 dollars, income of families in the 20th percentile of the income distribution, holders of hunting licenses, and total motor vehicle registrations. Gun ownership had no statistically significant effect on the homicide rate, but homicide rates had positive and significant impact on ownership rates. New handguns introduced into the inventory were not related to the homicide rates. Gun ownership levels did appear to affect robbery rates, which in turn affect homicide rates. The contrast between these findings and studies based on pre-1964 data can be attributed to a change in the pattern of gun ownership during the 1960's and 1970's. In this period, gun ownership among the violence-prone was increasing faster than within the general population, and the general level of gun ownership became a poor indicator of ownership among the violence-prone. Only a tiny fraction of guns or gun owners are involved in crime, and gun ownership among the law-abiding has no effect on homicide rates. These findings argue against banning all guns, but are compatible with moderate controls such as licensing and laws restricting the open or concealed carrying of weapons.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Hopelessness is a common experience of patients with depressive disorders (DD) and an important predictor of suicidal behaviour. However, stability and factors explaining state and trait variation of hopelessness in patients with DD over time are poorly known. 

METHODS
Patients with DD (n = 406) from the Vantaa Depression Study and the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study filled in the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Social Support Scale–Revised (PSSS-R), and Eysenck Personality Inventory–Q (EPI-Q) at baseline, at six and eighteen months, and at five years. We conducted a multilevel linear regression analyses predicting BHS with these covariates. 

RESULTS
During the five-year follow-up half of the variance in BHS was attributable to between-patient variance (50.6{\%}, CI = 41.2–61.5{\%}), and the rest arose from within-patient variance and measurement errors. BDI and BAI explained 5.6{\%} of within-patient and 28.4{\%} of between-patient variance of BHS. High Neuroticism and low Extraversion explained 2.6{\%} of the between-patient variance of BHS. PSSS-R explained 5{\%} of between-patient variance and 1.7{\%} of within-patient variance of BHS. 

LIMITATIONS
No treatment effects were controlled. 

CONCLUSIONS
Hopelessness varies markedly over time both within and between patients with depression; it is both state- and trait-related. Concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms and low social support explain both state and trait variance, whereas high Neuroticism and low Extraversion explain only trait variance of hopelessness. These variations influence the utility of hopelessness as an indicator of suicide risk.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) exhibit dysregulated emotion sequences in daily life compared to healthy controls (HC). Empirical evidence regarding the specificity of these findings is currently lacking. Methods: To replicate dysregulated emotion sequences in patients with BPD and to investigate the specificity of the sequences, we used e-diaries of 43 female patients with BPD, 28 patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 28 HC. To capture the rapid dynamics of emotions, we prompted participants every 15 min over a 24-h period to assess their current perceived emotions. We analyzed group differences in terms of activation, persistence, switches, and down-regulation of emotion sequences. Results: By comparing patients with BPD to HC, we replicated five of the seven previously reported dysregulated emotion sequences, as well as 111 out of 113 unaltered sequences. However, none of the previously reported dysregulated emotion sequences exhibited specificity, i.e., none revealed higher frequencies compared to the PTSD group or the BN group. Beyond these findings, we revealed a specific finding for patients with BN, as they most frequently switched from anger to disgust. Conclusions: Replicating previously found dysregulated and unaltered emotional sequences strengthens the significance of emotion sequences. However, the lack of specificity points to emotion sequences as transdiagnostic features.},

abstract = {Social isolation and depression are tightly linked and can reinforce each other in a vicious cycle. Yet, the antecedents of this complex cycle are not well understood. To date, little is known about how the dynamics of social isolation in daily life (i.e., solitude) play a role in this cycle. To investigate these complex dynamics, we introduce the concept of solitude inertia, which captures individuals' tendencies to remain in social states of solitude. We argue that, although short-term solitude can have both positive and negative effects on individuals' depressive symptoms, prolonged states of solitude (i.e., high solitude inertia) are detrimental. At the same time, individuals with depression might be more vulnerable to "get stuck" in solitude. In this study, we tease apart the bidirectional relationship between solitude inertia and depressive symptoms. We use data from the MindMaastricht study in which 129 individuals with residual depressive symptoms participated in two experience sampling assessments phases (T1 and T2) that were 8 weeks apart (Nobs = 11,558). Using logistic multilevel models, we find that higher levels of depressive symptoms are related to higher solitude inertia. We further show that depressive symptoms at T1 are not predictive of solitude inertia at T2. However, solitude inertia at T1 was predictive of depressive symptoms eight weeks later (T2) in a linear regression analysis. This study introduces and highlights the role of solitude inertia as a potential intervention target in social isolation and depression dynamics.},

abstract = {Regional development agencies (RDA) are the units established for accelerating regional development and increasing local capacity. They aim at activating the regional dynamics and to reduce the intra-regional and inter-regional development gap. In a region, each province may have a different development level. This would pose a problem for socio-economic development. In order to reduce the disparities among the provinces, financial support mechanisms of development agencies would be a beneficial influence only if supports are used with to correct strategies. In order to play a vital role to reduce intra-regional disparities, it is necessary to consider many criteria to categorise settlements in terms of socio-economic development. Some of these criteria are generally subjective and extremely difficult to express in numbers. However, fuzzy sets are a great help to decision makers in a prioritisation of provinces for public grants allocation process with linguistic variables and measurement challenges. In this study, a new city-ranking model has been proposed for development agencies operating in Turkey. To address ambiguities and relativities in real-world scenarios more conveniently, type-2 fuzzy sets and crisp sets have been simultaneously used in multicriteria decision making (MCDM) process of grants allocation. To illustrate the proposed model better, an application with real case data has been performed in the Middle Black Sea Development Agency in Turkey.

For each individual a latent class variable is measured at each time point and the latent class changes across time follow a Markov process (i.e., a hidden or latent Markov model), with subject-specific transition probabilities that are estimated as random effects. Such a model for single-subject data has been referred to as the regime-switching state-space model. The latent class variable can be measured by continuous or categorical indicators, under the local independence condition, or more generally by a class-specific structural equation model or a dynamic structural equation model. We discuss the Bayesian estimation based on Markov chain Monto Carlo, which allows modeling with arbitrary long time series data and many random effects. The modeling framework is illustrated with several simulation studies.},

abstract = {Previous studies indicated that the assumption of logistic form of parametric item response functions (IRFs) is violated often enough to be worth checking. Using nonparametric item response theory (IRT) estimation methods with the posterior predictive model checking method can obtain significance probabilities of fit statistics in a Bayesian framework by accounting for the uncertainty of the parameter estimation and can indicate the location and magnitude of misfit for an item. The purpose of this study is to check the performance of the Bayesian nonparametric method to assess the IRF fit of parametric IRT models for mixed-format tests and compare it with the existing bootstrapping nonparametric method under various conditions. The simulation study results show that the Bayesian nonparametric method can detect misfit items with higher power and lower type I error rates when the sample size is large and with lower type I error rates compared with the bootstrapping method for the conditions with nonmonotonic items. In the real-data study, several dichotomous and polytomous misfit items were identified and the location and magnitude of misfit were indicated.},

The present study examined positive emotion-cognition interactions among individuals in partial remission from depression who had been randomly assigned to treatment with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; n = 64) or a waitlist control condition (n = 66). We hypothesized that MBCT stimulates upward spirals by increasing positive affect and positive cognition. Experience sampling assessed changes in affect and cognition during 6 days before and after treatment, which were analyzed with a series of multilevel and autoregressive latent trajectory models. Findings suggest that MBCT was associated with significant increases in trait positive affect and momentary positive cognition, which were preserved through autoregressive and cross-lagged effects driven by global emotional tone. Findings suggest that daily positive affect and cognition are maintained by an upward spiral that might be promoted by mindfulness training.},

While most agree that there is no one preferred approach, it has also been argued that cluster mean centering is desirable when the within-cluster slope and the between-cluster slope are expected to deviate, and the main interest is in the within-cluster slope. However, we show in a series of simulations that if one has a multilevel autoregressive model in which the level 1 predictor is the lagged outcome variable (i.e., the outcome variable at the previous occasion), cluster mean centering will in general lead to a downward bias in the parameter estimate of the within-cluster slope (i.e., the autoregressive relationship). This is particularly relevant if the main question is whether there is on average an autoregressive effect. Nonetheless, we show that if the main interest is in estimating the effect of a level 2 predictor on the autoregressive parameter (i.e., a cross-level interaction), cluster mean centering should be preferred over other forms of centering. Hence, researchers should be clear on what is considered the main goal of their study, and base their choice of centering method on this when using a multilevel autoregressive model.},

This theory applies whenever we study the consistency of behavior, its variability, and its change over time. States and traits are defined in terms of probability theory. This allows for a seamless transition from theory to statistical modeling of empirical data. LST-R theory not only gives insights into the nature of latent variables but it also takes into account four fundamental facts: Observations are fallible, they never happen in a situational vacuum, they are always made using a specific method of observations, and there is no person without a past. Although the first fact necessitates considering measurement error, the second fact requires allowances for situational fluctuations. The third fact implies that, in the first place, states and traits are method specific.

abstract = {Two-level theories explain outcomes with causal variables at two levels of analysis that are systematically related to one another Although many prominent scholars in the field of comparative analysis have developed two-level theories, the empirical and methodological issues that these theories raise have yet to be investigated. In this article, the authors explore different structures of two-level theories and consider the issues involved in testing these theories with fuzzy-set methods. They show that grasping the overall structure of two-level theories requires both specifying the particular type of relationship that exists between and within levels of analysis and specifying the logical linkages between levels in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. They argue that for the purposes of testing these theories, fuzzy-set analysis provides a powerful set of tools. However to realize this potential, investigators using fuzzy-set methods must be clear about the two-level structure of their theories from the onset.

abstract = {HowNutsAreTheDutch (Dutch: HoeGekIsNL) is a national crowdsourcing study designed to investigate multiple continuous mental health dimensions in a sample from the general population (n=12,503). Its main objective is to create an empirically based representation of mental strengths and vulnerabilities, accounting for (i) dimensionality and heterogeneity, (ii) interactivity between symptoms and strengths, and (iii) intra-individual variability. To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross-sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine-grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time. Measuring both psychiatric symptomatology and mental strengths and resources enables for an investigation of their interactions, which may underlie the wide variety of observed mental states in the population. The present paper describes the applied methods and technology, and presents the sample characteristics.},

abstract = {In general, blacks and whites share similar attitudes toward fear of crime, leniency in sentencing, confidence in the courts, control of pornography and drugs, and gun ownership. Striking differences can be found in their perceptions of the acceptability of police use of physical force, gun control, teenage gangs, capital punishment, and satisfaction with law enforcement officials. These differences can be explained in terms of differences in the nature of the question, the residential context of the respondent, and cultural and value differences. Although these data suffer from many biases, both UCR and arrest data show a disproportionately high involvement of blacks in crime, especially violent crime. In contrast to UCR data, which include only crimes reported to police, NCS data examine victimization and unreported crimes. Analysis based on seriousness of victimization suggests that the strongest relationships are to age, sex, and race, with blacks suffering more serious victimization than whites. Blacks experienced more motor vehicle thefts and burglaries than whites, but larceny rates were similar for the groups. Finally, data show that a majority of all crimes are not reported. Theft crimes appeared to be reported at virtually the same rate for black and white households, while blacks reported a higher rate of violent crimes. Factors affecting reporting are complex, and include victim age, sex, and type of crime. Correlations (or their lack) between UCR and NCS data suggest that race/crime relationships are complex, and that the official picture of black crime is unrepresentative and too simplistic. Six data tables and four references are provided.},

Emotional inertia refers to the degree to which emotional states are resistant to change. Because psychological maladjustment has been associated with both emotional underreactivity and ineffective emotion-regulation skills, we hypothesized that its overall emotion dynamics would be characterized by high levels of inertia. We provide evidence from two naturalistic studies that, using different methods, showed that the emotional fluctuations of individuals who exhibited low self-esteem (Study 1) and depression (Study 2) were characterized by higher levels of inertia in both positive and negative emotions than the emotional fluctuations of people who did not exhibit low self-esteem and depression. We also discuss the usefulness of the concept of emotional inertia as a hallmark of maladaptive emotion dynamics.},

abstract = {Experiential avoidance (EA) is an emotion-regulation strategy used to control or avoid unpleasant internal experiences. Despite the important role of avoidance in depressive disorders, there is relatively little research directly examining the role of EA in the development and maintenance of depression, and most of this research relies on measurement of EA as a global and stable personality trait. In this study we sought to extend the research on EA and depression by using a daily diary design and multilevel analysis to examine how the daily relationship between EA and negative affect (NA) varies as a function of baseline depressive symptoms. In order to achieve this goal we created a new state measure of EA assessing several avoidant behaviors. The findings revealed that participants with more depressive symptoms used more daily EA overall. Additionally, the difference in daily EA between those with higher versus lower depressive symptoms was greater on days when participants experienced less NA. This moderation effect was found only concurrently whereas one-day lagged analysis failed to reveal this effect. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that depression is associated with an inflexibly high level of avoidant emotion regulation.},

Drawing on the social investment principle of personality change, we argue that trust propensity has situationally specific components and is likely to be less stable during periods of career transition. Using a latent curve-latent state-trait model, we present evidence that suggests that trust propensity has stable (trait) and unstable (state) components during career transition periods and that it has the potential to change over time. Our results are replicated across two, transitional workplace populations during a process of (re)socialization into an organization. In our second study, we also expand our focus to examine correlates of trust propensity and demonstrate the relationship between state and trait trust propensity and cognitive depletion. Our paper significantly extends knowledge of the nature of trust propensity and raises questions about the stability of this construct, one of the core tenets of trust theory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Previous research indicates that social anxiety (SA) is a risk factor for the maintenance and relapse of smoking behaviors. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The current study tested the effects of state and trait levels of SA as well as smoking to cope with symptoms of SA on craving during a social stressor task in abstinent conditions. 

METHODS
Participants (n = 60) were daily smokers, aged 18–30. Participants attended two sessions: a baseline session and a second session, wherein they engaged in a social stressor task while deprived from nicotine for 24 h. Subjective ratings of cigarette craving and state levels of SA were assessed six times throughout the task. Data were analyzed via multilevel modeling. 

RESULTS
Both trait SA and some forms of smoking to cope with symptoms of SA were more likely to predict increased craving during times of high, relative to low, social stress. Further, individuals with higher state SA, greater smoking to cope behaviors, and those who experience greater relief of social distress by smoking experienced greater craving throughout the task. These effects remained after controlling for nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms, depression, and other symptoms of anxiety and stress. Smoking to cope with symptoms of SA did not moderate the relationship between state SA and craving. 

CONCLUSIONS
Smokers high in SA (state and trait) and smoking to cope with symptoms of SA may be at risk for continued smoking and relapse because of the intensity of cravings they experience during stressful social situations.},

Data were collected from 364 college students over five days. Intraclass correlation coefficients suggested approximately equal amounts of variability at the trait and state levels. Multilevel factor analysis revealed that the model specifying two correlated factors (PA, NA) and correlated uniqueness terms among redundant items provided the best fit. Trait and state PA and NA were generally associated with stress, anxiety, depression, and three types of self-esteem (performance, academic, social). The coefficients describing these relationships differed somewhat, suggesting that trait and state measurement may have different predictive utility.},

abstract = {A rationale for investigating subcultures of firearms ownership is developed. Two gun-owning populations are investigated by using survey data for the State of Illinois, those who own guns for sport and those who own guns for protection. Models of individual level gun ownership for sport and for protection are constructed and tested. Sporting gun ownership appears to be subcultural. Sporting gun ownership can be predicted by using family socialization variables and indicators of contact among members of the subculture, independent of situational variables. Protective ownership has none of the trappings of a subculture. It does not respond to family socialization and indicators of contact with other people who own guns for protection. Further, there is no indication of a subculture of violence among protective gun owners. Violent attitudes and behavior do not predict protective gun ownership. In fact, a situational variable (county violent crime) was the only predictor of gun ownership for protection. Further, gun ownership for protection and gun ownership for sport were found to be independent events, with no joint probability of occurrence. This suggests that the impetus for a subculture of protective ownership could not be a logical extension of a subculture of firearms ownership for sport.},

abstract = {Probabilistic approaches to rough sets are still an important issue in rough set theory. Although many studies have been written on this topic, they focus on approximating a crisp concept in the universe of discourse, with less effort on approximating a fuzzy concept in the universe of discourse. This article investigates the rough approximation of a fuzzy concept on a probabilistic approximation space over two universes. We first present the definition of a lower and upper approximation of a fuzzy set with respect to a probabilistic approximation space over two universes by defining the conditional probability of a fuzzy event. That is, we define the rough fuzzy set on a probabilistic approximation space over two universes. We then define the fuzzy probabilistic approximation over two universes by introducing a probability measure to the approximation space over two universes. Then, we establish the fuzzy rough set model on the probabilistic approximation space over two universes. Meanwhile, we study some properties of both rough fuzzy sets and fuzzy rough sets on the probabilistic approximation space over two universes. Also, we compare the proposed model with the existing models to show the superiority of the model given in this paper. Furthermore, we apply the fuzzy rough set on the probabilistic approximation over two universes to emergency decision-making in unconventional emergency management. We establish an approach to online emergency decision-making by using the fuzzy rough set model on the probabilistic approximation over two universes. Finally, we apply our approach to a numerical example of emergency decision-making in order to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.

Adolescents in cities possess and carry guns on a large scale, guns are often at the scene of youth violence, and guns often are used. Guns play a central role in initiating, sustaining, and elevating the epidemic of youth violence. The demand for guns among youth was fueled by an "ecology of danger," comprising street gangs, expanding drug markets with high intrinsic levels of violence, high rates of adult violence and fatalities, and cultural styles of gun possession and carrying. Guns became symbols of respect, power, identity, and manhood to a generation of youth, in addition to having strategic value for survival. The relationship between guns and youth violence is complex. The effects of guns are mediated by structural factors that increase the youth demand for guns, the available supply, and culture and scripts which teach kids lethal ways to use guns.},

abstract = {Background: Many persons living with HIV (PLWH) are nonadherent to medication. Trait level measures that ask about predictors of adherence in the abstract may not adequately capture state level daily variability that more directly impacts adherence.

Objectives: This preliminary study was designed to test six predictors of electronically monitored adherence at both the state and trait levels and to compare their relative effects.

Methods: Using a smartphone, 87 PLWH completed randomly cued daily surveys on thoughts, mood, stress, coping, social support, and treatment motivation. All participants also completed baseline surveys on each construct. These state and trait variables were tested as prospective predictors of next-day adherence in multilevel models, and their relative importance was quantified. The analysis sample consisted of 53 PLWH who stored their most frequent antiretroviral medication in a bottle that time-stamped openings to measure adherence.

Results: Higher state level motivation, OR = 1.55, 95{\%} CI [1.07, 2.24], and negative mood, OR = 1.33, 95{\%} CI [1.07, 1.63], predicted greater adherence the following day. Importantly, these effects were only found at the state level. Trait level control beliefs predicted greater adherence, OR = 1.65, 95{\%} CI [1.17, 2.35], but contrary to prediction, validated trait level measures of mood, stress, coping, social support, and motivation did not.

Discussion: Trait and state level measures predicted adherence, but there were differences between them. Motivation for treatment and negative mood predicted adherence when measured the preceding day, but not as aggregate measures. At the trait level, only control beliefs predicted adherence. Researchers should consider state level variations in mood and motivation as possible explanations for nonadherence. Interventions could be developed to target state level variables.},

abstract = {Posits that the distinction between state and trait is an arbitrary one and presents a delineation and analysis of factors that have contributed to the propagation of the distinction. Observational, philosophical, and empirical sources of evidence are cited. Three beliefs are examined: (a) that a label can refer to both a state and a trait; (b) that whether an instrument measures state or trait depends on the accompanying instructions; and (c) that state and trait are so inextricably tied that a measure of state is used to derive an index of trait. Overlap among terms used in the Profile of Mood States, the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, the Adjective Check List, Cattell's (1943) list of personality labels, and the Allport-Odbert (1936) categories is presented. Empirical illustrations are cited in support of the contention that the state–trait distinction can be used to explain almost any personality research finding post hoc.},

abstract = {Depression has often been associated with increased negative affect reactivity to stress (Stress-Sensitivity) and reduced capacity to experience pleasure or positive affect (Reward Experience). To date, no studies have prospectively examined changes in Stress-Sensitivity and Reward Experience following antidepressant treatment. The sample included 83 depressed patients and 22 healthy controls. A randomized controlled trial was carried out with patients receiving either imipramine or placebo for 6 weeks. At baseline and 6 weeks, patients and controls participated in an Experience Sampling procedure, prospectively measuring ecologically valid daily life appraisals of activities and mood states. The course of depression was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Multilevel linear regression analyses showed that patients had higher negative and lower positive appraisals of activities than controls. In addition, patients showed increased Stress-Sensitivity (negative affect reactivity to negatively appraised activities). Treatment with imipramine decreased Stress-Sensitivity and increased Reward Experience (positive affect reactivity to positively appraised activities). Changes in Stress-Sensitivity and Reward Experience were in part reducible to changes in the process of activity appraisal itself. However, increase in Reward Experience, but not decrease in Stress-Sensitivity, discriminated between patients who responded and those who did not, independent of changes in the process of activity appraisal itself. Response to treatment in depression may be conditional on restoration of hedonic capacity, the cerebral substrate of which requires further study in relation to antidepressant response. A search for (synergistic) antidepressant therapies specifically targeting ability to experience reward may be warranted. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A discussion of the extent and character of violent crime in the last 13 years notes that the rate of violent crime has increased in the United States and that the Nation's rate is extremely high when compared with similar nations. An analysis of public policies to deal with violent crime argues that both the recent trend toward increased incarceration and the liberal policies of preceding years have failed. It recommends strategies that will focus on the individual, the family, and the social reconstruction of the community. The disproportionate level of crime and violence among black Americans is examined in the context of the history of the black experience and the negative consequences for blacks of public policies and attitudes. A discussion of public policy toward crime prevention emphasizes the need for citizen involvement as the central element. The role of national commissions in suggesting public policies to address criminal violence is explored. Trends in the ownership and use of guns since the late 1960's are described, with emphasis on public attitudes and policy implications. Factors contributing to the decline in collective violence since the 1960's and to the likelihood of renewed collective violence in the future are discussed. The need for increased attention to the problem of terrorism is explained. A concluding article recommends public policies that focus on strengthening extended families and increasing employment among minority youths, and helping indigenous inner-city organizations take the lead in reducing crime and fear of crime. The limitations of the criminal justice system in preventing violence are also discussed. Chapter reference lists, an appendix presenting data tables, biographies of contributors, and an index are supplied.},

abstract = {Despite large efforts to understand emotional instability in borderline personality disorder (BPD), it is still unclear exactly how this is manifested in the daily lives of people suffering from the disorder. Building on theoretical and clinical observations of BPD, we propose that the emotional instability in BPD particularly consists of the occurrence of strong changes between positive and negative emotional states from 1 moment to the next, labeled emotional switching. We tested this proposal by means of an experience sampling study in which 30 BPD patients and 28 healthy controls reported in their daily lives the level of pleasantness/unpleasantness of their emotional states 10 times a day for 8 consecutive days using handheld palmtops. Results showed that although BPD patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding their overall tendency to switch from a positive to a negative emotional state or vice versa, the size of such changes between positive and negative states was found to be significantly larger in BPD patients. In contrast, the magnitude of emotional changes that remained within the negative emotional range or positive emotional range was not particularly larger for BPD patients compared with healthy participants. These findings imply that the emotional instability in BPD is particularly characterized by larger changes from positive to negative states and vice versa, rather than overall larger changes in intensity, providing insight into possible processes underlying emotion dysfunction in BPD.},

abstract = {I review and test predictions of fuzzy-trace theory by bridging health and medical information with effective communications that influence decision making. First, I present an overview of the theory, describing the theory's core principles and evidence in the areas of risk perception, prevention, detection, diagnosis of disease, and decision making regarding treatment (Chapter 2). I then present findings from interventions based on fuzzy-trace theory designed to improve health and medical decision making. Fuzzy-trace theory provides guidelines for development of such interventions because it predicts reactions to health messages and explains the causal mechanisms of judgment and decision making. Second, I empirically address these predictions in a series of experiments (Chapters 3 and 4). In Chapter 3, I develop and test an intervention grounded in fuzzy-trace theory to prevent obesity (which is one of the most common risk factors for negative health outcomes). In three experiments, 864 subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental tutorial or a control tutorial with unrelated content. The experimental condition, GistFit, consisted of a static, text-based intervention (Experiment 1) or an online intervention using Sharable Knowledge Objects, a web-based tutoring system that uses artificial intelligence technology to create an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), GistFitITS (Experiments 2 and 3). Subjects answered questions of knowledge, gist comprehension, psychosocial mediators of behavior (e.g., attitudes, gist principles), behavioral intentions, and self-reported behavior about nutrition and fitness. The interventions improved endorsement of gist principles (or simple values). Exposure to the revised GistFitITS also resulted in significantly higher scores on gist and verbatim knowledge and gist comprehension compared to control. In Chapter 4, I further explore the benefits of using the web-based tutoring system, GistFitITS, in a randomized, controlled experiment with 251 subjects. Engagement in tutorial dialogues revealed significant correlations with knowledge tests, gist comprehension, and endorsement of gist principles, which correlated with intentions to perform healthier behavior and self-reported behavior. Overall, results were consistent with fuzzy-trace theory, suggesting that GistFitITS instills active understanding that promotes gist-based thinking, not a passive memorization of verbatim details, to assist people in making preventive health decisions.

abstract = {This paper considers nonparametric estimation in a varying coefficient model with repeated measurements (Yij, Xij, tij), for i = 1,..., ni and j = 1,..., ni, where Xij=(Xijo,..., xijk)T and (Yij, Xij, tij) denote the jth outcome, covariate and time design points, respectively, of the ith subject. The model considered here is Yij = XijT{\{}beta{\}}(tij) + +i(tij), where {\{}beta{\}}(t) = ({\{}beta{\}}0(t), ..., Bk(t))T, for k [greater double equals] 0, are smooth nonparametric functions of interest and {\{}varepsilon{\}}i(t) is a zero-mean stochastic process. The measurements are assumed to be independent for different subjects but can be correlated at different time points within each subject. Two nonparametric estimators of {\{}beta{\}}(t), namely a smoothing spline and a locally weighted polynomial, are derived for such repeatedly measured data. A crossvalidation criterion is proposed for the selection of the corresponding smoothing parameters. Asymptotic properties, such as consistency, rates of convergence and asymptotic mean squared errors, are established for kernel estimators, a special case of the local polynomials. These asymptotic results give useful insights into the reliability of our general estimation methods. An example of predicting the growth of children born to HIV infected mothers based on gender, HIV status and maternal vitamin A levels shows that this model and the corresponding nonparametric estimators are useful in epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {Objective: Daily life affective responses are closely linked to vulnerability and resilience in depression. Prediction of future clinical course may be improved if information on daily life emotional response patterns is taken into account. Method: Female subjects with a history of major depression (n = 83), recruited from a population twin register, participated in a longitudinal study using momentary assessment technology with 4 follow-up measurements. The effect of baseline daily life emotional response patterns (affect variability, stress-sensitivity and reward experience) on follow-up depressive symptomatology was examined. Results: Both reward experience (B = -0.30, p = 0.001) and negative affect variability (B = 0.46, p = 0.001) predicted future negative affective symptoms independent of all other dynamic emotional patterns and conventional predictors. Conclusion: Daily life information on dynamic emotional patterns adds to the prediction of future clinical course, independent of severity of symptoms and neuroticism score. Better prediction of course may improve decision-making regarding quantitative and qualitative aspects of treatment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Variation in the concept of social capital casts difficulties in measurements; moreover, measuring social capital requires different methods because concepts can differ by countries, regions and also according to the conceptual attributes included in the concept. Discussion on social capital has been gaining much attention in also East Asia, where Confucianism and family oriented values are suggested to be an important cultural background. This study aims to first critically review research on social capital not only in Korea, but also elsewhere, with a focus on measurements and indicators. By highlighting the importance of developing measurement that can reflect the cultural context of social capital, we compose survey questionnaires, which include multiple aspects of social capital and conduct an investigation on Korean social capital. Then, we exploit factor analysis with these questions. Next, with results from the factor analysis above, we employ the method of fuzzy set ideal type approach in order to measure social capital in Korea according to different demographic groups. The results suggest that people with low education and low income have difficulties participating in the society through interactions, even when their trust toward the society and their consciousness regarding the norm are similar to those of the other groups in Korea.

Differences within each twin pair were used as a direct measure of non-shared environmental effects. The Trait-State-Occasion (TSO) model developed by Cole et al. (Psychological Methods, 10, 3–20, 2005) was used to separate the non-shared environmental effects into stable factors, and transient factors that excluded measurement error. Stable factors explained, on average, 44 {\%} and 39 {\%} of the environmental variance in hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms, respectively. Transient effects explained the remaining 56 {\%} and 60 {\%} of variance. The proportion of stable variance was higher than expected based on previous research, suggesting promise for targeted interventions if future research identifies these stable risk factors.},

Moreover, dynamic factor analysis is shown to be applicable to a relatively short stretch of observations and therefore is considered worthwhile for psychological research. At several places the argumentation is clarified through the use of examples.},

Including random innovation variance is an important extension of the multilevel AR(1) model for two reasons. First, between-person differences in innovation variance are important from a substantive point of view, in that they capture differences in sensitivity and/or exposure to unmeasured internal and external factors that influence the process. Second, using simulation methods we show that modeling the innovation variance as fixed across individuals, when it should be modeled as a random effect, leads to biased parameter estimates. Additionally, we use simulation methods to compare maximum likelihood estimation to Bayesian estimation of the multilevel AR(1) model and investigate the trade-off between the number of individuals and the number of time points. We provide an empirical illustration by applying the extended multilevel AR(1) model to daily positive affect ratings from 89 married women over the course of 42 consecutive days.},

abstract = {At the heart of attitudinal and strategic explanations of judicial behavior is the assumption that justices have policy preferences. In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.},

abstract = {Researchers who use ambulatory assessment methods and various types of diaries are increasingly (almost invariably) using some type of multilevel technique to analyze their data. This reflects the fact that the data collected in such studies are inherently multilevel. A sample of individuals provides data on a repeated basis, creating a multilevel data structure in which people constitute one level of analysis and the repeated measures they provide constitute another level, or levels, of analysis. In this chapter I discuss multilevel random coefficient modeling (MLM), the technique that is currently thought to be the best way to analyze such multilevel data structures. I introduce MLM and present ways of using MLM that are well suited for analyzing data generated in ambulatory assessment and diary studies. When writing this chapter, I tried to address the needs of two audiences: researchers who are quire familiar with MLM to analyze data collected using ambulatory assessment and other intensive repeated measures, and scholars (both new and established) who are not at all familiar with such applications. To address the needs of these different audiences I have provided sufficient introductory material to allow those who are unfamiliar to understand the basic principles involved, while describing more sophisticated applications for the benefit of those who are already familiar. Consequently, those who are familiar with MLM analyses of diary data may wish to skip or skim introductory sections and focus on sections dealing with specific topics or applications. I discuss MLM in terms of the types of multilevel data that are frequently collected in ambulatory assessment and diary research, although much of what I discuss can be applied to other types of data. Moreover, to illustrate certain points, I often refer to my own research. I have done this not because I am the only the person who has used MLM to analyze these types of data (quite the opposite; there are many experienced and knowledgeable scholars who have published MLM-based studies in this area); rather, I am more familiar with my own studies than I am with the work of others.},

(1985) have suggested a measure of protective handgun ownership that can be implemented in an omnibus survey like the General Social Survey (GSS), which does not ask respondents why they own the gun. Using the 1980 GSS and their refined measure, Hill et al. report (among other things) that fear of crime and prior victimization increase the likelihood that men, but not women, will own handguns for protection. Their analysis, however, is flawed because (1) they made errors in their analysis and (2) their measure of protective handgun ownership is biased.

abstract = {Drawing valid inferences about daily or long-term dynamics of psychological constructs (e.g., depression) requires the measurement model (indicating which constructs are measured by which items) to be invariant within persons over time. However, it might be affected by time- or situation-specific artifacts (e.g., response styles) or substantive changes in item interpretation. To efficiently evaluate longitudinal measurement invariance, and violations thereof, we proposed Latent Markov factor analysis (LMFA), which clusters observations based on their measurement model into separate states, indicating which measures are validly comparable. LMFA is, however, tailored to “discrete-time” data, where measurement intervals are equal, which is often not the case in longitudinal data. In this paper, we extend LMFA to accommodate unequally spaced intervals. The so-called “continuous-time” (CT) approach considers the measurements as snapshots of continuously evolving processes. A simulation study compares CT-LMFA parameter estimation to its discrete-time counterpart and a depression data application shows the advantages of CT-LMFA.},

The results show that the relation between SWB and income is primarily driven by stable individual differences whereas transient changes in income are weakly related to transient changes in SWB.

First, the truth values of logical propositions span a set of linguistic terms such as true, very true, almost false, very false, and false. Second, the logic allows logical categories to overlap in contrast to Boolean logic, where the two possible logical categories, "true" and "false," are sharply distinct. A game becomes a linguistic fuzzy logic game by turning strategies into linguistic fuzzy strategies, players' preferences into linguistic fuzzy preferences, and the rules of reasoning and inferences of the game into linguistic fuzzy reasoning operating according to linguistic fuzzy logic. This leads to the introduction of a new notion of linguistic fuzzy domination and linguistic Nash equilibrium.},

abstract = {Intensive longitudinal data provide rich information, which is best captured when specialized models are used in the analysis. One of these models is the multilevel autoregressive model, which psychologists have applied successfully to study affect regulation as well as alcohol use. A limitation of this model is that the autoregressive parameter is treated as a fixed, trait-like property of a person. We argue that the autoregressive parameter may be state-dependent, for example, if the strength of affect regulation depends on the intensity of affect experienced. To allow such intra-individual variation, we propose a multilevel threshold autoregressive model. Using simulations, we show that this model can be used to detect state-dependent regulation with adequate power and Type I error. The potential of the new modeling approach is illustrated with two empirical applications that extend the basic model to address additional substantive research questions.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the growing interest in the experience sampling method (ESM) as a data collection tool for mental health research, the absence of methodological guidelines related to its use has resulted in a large heterogeneity of designs. Concomitantly, the potential effects of the design on the response behavior of the participants remain largely unknown. Objective: The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between various sample and design characteristics and the compliance and retention rates of studies using ESM in mental health research. Methods: ESM studies investigating major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder were considered for inclusion. Besides the compliance and retention rates, a number of sample and design characteristics of the selected studies were collected to assess their potential relationships with the compliance and retention rates. Multilevel random/mixed effects models were used for the analyses. Results: Compliance and retention rates were lower for studies with a higher proportion of male participants (P{\textless}.001) and individuals with a psychotic disorder (P{\textless}.001). Compliance was positively associated with the use of a fixed sampling scheme (P=.02), higher incentives (P=.03), higher time intervals between successive evaluations (P=.02), and fewer evaluations per day (P=.008), while no significant associations were observed with regard to the mean age of the sample, the study duration, or other design characteristics. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that ESM studies can be carried out in mental health research, but the quality of the data collection depends upon a number of factors related to the design of ESM studies and the samples under study that need to be considered when designing such protocols.},

abstract = {Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of anxiety and anger/hostility were obtained every 25–30min over two 24-h periods, separated by a median of 6months, from 165 employees at a university in the Northeast. We used a multilevel trait-state-error structural equation model to estimate: (1) the proportion of variance in EMA anxiety and anger/hostility attributable to stable trait-like individual differences; (2) the correspondence between these trait-like components of EMA anxiety and anger/hostility and traditional questionnaire measures of each construct; and (3) the test–retest correlation between two 24-h averages obtained several months apart. After adjustment for measurement error, more than half the total variance in EMA reports of anxiety and anger/hostility is attributable to stable trait-like individual differences; however, the trait-like component of each construct is only modestly correlated with questionnaire measures of that construct. The 6-month “test–retest” correlations of latent variables representing the true 24-h EMA average anxiety and average anger are quite high (r⩾0.83). This study represents the longest follow-up period over which EMA-based estimates of traits have been examined. The results suggest that although the trait component (individual differences) of EMA momentary ratings of anxiety and anger is larger than the state component, traditional self-report questionnaires of trait anxiety and anger correspond only weakly with EMA-defined traits.},

The program includes the presentation of slides of handgun victims to impress upon HIP participants the nature of handgun violence. The program also provides information on guns and the high risk of violence that comes from carrying a gun. Presentations by older felons are designed to persuade HIP participants to turn from their ways before it is too late. The evaluation research used an experimental group (n=446) and a control group to determine whether the program achieved a change of attitudes in seven general areas. These categories are risks/benefits of guns, inevitability of gun violence, ethical considerations, status motivations, personal responsibility, situational avoidance, and knowledge of gun risks. Based on a before-and-after measurement of attitudes among HIP participants, the study found statistically significant movements in the anticipated direction for 19 of 21 attitudes, suggesting that HIP does change participant attitudes regarding handguns and handgun violence over the short term. Discussions with six focus groups of HIP participants, however, suggest that they may have difficulty over the long term, given the strong influence in urban neighborhoods to use handguns for self-protection. The evaluation is working on a structure for measuring rearrests among experimental and control group members. Judge Lipscomb of Michigan's 36th District Court discusses the program elements and some of its impacts on participants. Questions from the audience are included in the video.},

However, research also has shown that a variety of task and motivational factors lead to similar outcomes. Yet, little research has explored the potential interaction of transforma-tional leadership with these other factors. We utilize fuzzy-set I qualitative comparative analysis to explore the ways these factors may interact to produce positive employee outcomes. Specifically, we found that high levels of employee commitment and performance can be achieved in the absence of a transformational leader through various "bundles" of enriched jobs, challenging goals, and high quality leader-follower relationships.

Here we use dynamic multilevel modeling, as it is incorporated in the new dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) toolbox in Mplus, to analyze the affective data from the COGITO study. These data consist of two samples of over 100 individuals each who were measured for about 100 days. We use composite scores of positive and negative affect and apply a multilevel vector autoregressive model to allow for individual differences in means, autoregressions, and cross-lagged effects. Then we extend the model to include random residual variances and covariance, and finally we investigate whether prior depression affects later depression scores through the random effects of the daily diary measures. We end with discussing several urgent—but mostly unresolved—issues in the area of dynamic multilevel modeling.},

Analysis of carrying guns for protection, as opposed to having them in the home or owning them for this purpose, is argued to remove some methodological problems plaguing much previous research. Fear of crime is not found to be a significant predictor of carrying; however, gender and cultural context do have predictable influences. Males and persons residing in a traditionally southern cultural context carried guns most frequently, compared to others, for protection against crime. One important finding is an interaction effect between gender and culture: southern culture levels the difference between genders by increasing female more than male carrying of a gun.

Unremitting stressful conditions may be particularly pathogenic, but prior research has struggled to delimit chronic versus transient stressful experiences. We aimed to isolate stable stressors- theorized to be indicators of a latent stress proneness trait-and to examine their effects on the temporal course of depression and panic disorder. We recruited 677 patients diagnosed with an emotional disorder and administered interviews for psychopathology and life stress 3 times over 12-month intervals. Trait-state-occasion modeling revealed that 74{\%} of the variance in life stress was stable over the follow-up period. These stable stressors were associated with a more refractory course of depression and, to a smaller degree, panic disorder over time. In addition, neither gender nor participation in cognitive- behavioral therapy affected the persistence of environmental stress over the study time frame. We discuss implications of these findings for explaining depression recurrence, improving psychological interventions for emotional disorders, and the measurement and evaluation of stress proneness.},

It maximizes ecological validity and avoids the limitations of retrospective self-reports. Studies on the psychometric properties of scales administered via mobile phone ecological momentary assessment are lacking. Therefore, we collected data on a 4-item mood scale measuring well being on six occasions per day for 7 days (N = 307) and examined compliance rate across time, within day, and within week. Using specific latent state-trait structural equation models, we analyzed the degree to which interindividual mood differences on an occasion of measurement were because of (a) measurement error, (b) stable differences in mood level, and (c) occasion-specific differences. Results show good compliance (mean compliance: 74.9{\%} of calls answered). Moreover, the scale showed good reliability (M = .82). Mood was mostly stable, especially the first 3 days of the week. It depended weakly albeit significantly on the previous assessment (autoregressive coefficient). In conclusion, computerized mobile phone assessment is an appropriate, easy-to-use, and promising method to measure mood.},

The present study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by examining how PD traits are associated with emotional responses to subjective daily stressors, while accounting for cognition and type of stressor experienced (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal). PD features were measured with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality-2 (SNAP-2) diagnostic scores. Participants (N = 77) completed a 1-week experience sampling procedure that measured affect and cognition related to a current stressor 5 times per day. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to examine whether and how baseline PD features, momentary cognitions, and type of stressor predicted level of affect. Results demonstrated that paranoid, borderline, and avoidant PD traits predicted negative affect beyond what could be accounted for by cognitions and type of stressor. No PD traits predicted positive affect after accounting for the effects of cognitive appraisals and type of stressor. Findings have implications for validating the role of affect in PDs and understanding how individuals with PDs react in the presence of daily hassles. (PsycINFO Database Record},

(1) What are the relationships between trait and state level constructs, which include psychological states, the situations people experience and behaviour? (2) What are the relationships between psychological states, between states and situations and between states and behaviours? (3) How do such state level relationships vary as a function of trait level individual differences? (4) How do the relationships that are the focus of questions 1, 2, and 3 change across time? This article describes how to use multilevel random coefficient modelling (MRCM) to examine such relationships. The framework can accommodate different definitions of traits and dispositions (Allportian, processing styles, profiles, etc.) and different ways of conceptualising relationships between states and traits (aggregationist, interactionist, etc.).},

We suggest combining multilevel regression analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) in a two-step approach given the small number of countries for which cross-national survey data are available and the considerable number of potentially relevant and likely interdependent country-level characteristics. Based on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE 2012), sQoL in 2,470 older LTCRs from 14 countries was analyzed. Results of multilevel regression analyses (1) confirmed known individual-level determinants of sQoL and provided a weighted country-level outcome to be explained by fuzzy-set QCA, where (2) we found both necessary and sufficient (combinations of) country-level conditions for high- and low-quality-of-life countries in Europe. In combination, these two distinct methodological tools allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of country-level characteristics on sQoL in older LTCRs in Europe.

abstract = {In this article a continuous-time stochastic model (the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) is presented to model the perpetually altering states of the core affect, which is a 2-dimensional concept underlying all our affective experiences. The process model that we propose can account for the temporal changes in core affect on the latent level. The key parameters of the model are the average position (also called home base), the variances and covariances of the process, and the regulatory mechanisms that keep the process in the vicinity of the average position. To account for individual differences, the model is extended hierarchically. A particularly novel contribution is that in principle all parameters of the stochastic process (not only the mean but also its variance and the regulatory parameters) are allowed to differ between individuals. In this way, the aim is to understand the affective dynamics of single individuals and at the same time investigate how these individuals differ from one another. The final model is a continuous-time state-space model for repeated measurement data taken at possibly irregular time points. Both time-invariant and time-varying covariates can be included to investigate sources of individual differences. As an illustration, the model is applied to a diary study measuring core affect repeatedly for several individuals (thereby generating intensive longitudinal data).},

Four unique State-by-State data sets were used: the Comparative Homicide File, the State Stress Index, the Legitimate Violence Index, and a measure of gun availability for each State. The weapons considered in the study are handguns, shoulder guns, and sharp and blunt instruments. Stressful life events (as measured by the State Stress Index) were positively related to homicide deaths for all four types of weapons, with the relationships all being highly significant. Motivations toward lethal violence engendered by stress are thus not dependent on a particular type of weapon. Approval of violence (as represented by the Legitimate Violence Index) was associated with deaths from handguns, long guns, and to a lesser degree with sharp instruments. The lack of association between the Legitimate Violence Index and homicides involving blunt instruments prompted reconsideration of the connection between approval of violence and homicide. Path analysis indicates that the effect of stress on gun homicides was direct and was not linked through the intervening variable of gun ownership. 5 footnotes, 1 figure, 4 tables, 28 references.},

DSEM models intraindividual changes over time on Level 1 and allows the parameters of these processes to vary across individuals on Level 2 using random effects. DSEM merges time series, structural equation, multilevel, and time-varying effects models. Despite the well-known properties of these analysis areas by themselves, it is unclear how their sample size requirements and recommendations transfer to the DSEM framework. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the estimation quality of univariate 2-level autoregressive models of order 1, AR(1), using Bayesian analysis in Mplus Version 8. Three features are varied in the simulations: complexity of the model, number of subjects, and number of time points per subject. Samples with many subjects and few time points are shown to perform substantially better than samples with few subjects and many time points.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series data offer researchers opportunities to study dynamics of various systems in social and behavioral sciences. Dynamic factor model (DFM), as an idiographic approach for studying intraindividual variability and dynamics, has typically been applied to time series data obtained from a single unit. When multivariate time series data are collected from multiple units, how to synchronize dynamical information becomes a silent issue. To address this issue, the current study presented a multilevel dynamic factor model (MDFM) that analyzes multiple multivariate time series in multilevel SEM frameworks. MDFM not only disentangles within- and between-person variability but also models dynamics of the intraindividual processes. To illustrate the uses of MDFMs, we applied lag0, lag1, and lag2 MDFMs to empirical data on affect collected from 205 dating couples who had at least 50 consecutive days of observations. We also considered a model extension where the dynamical coefficients were allowed to be randomly varying in the population. The empirical analysis yielded interesting findings regarding affect regulation and coregulation within couples, demonstrating promising uses of MDFMs in analyzing multiple multivariate time series. In the end, we discussed a number of methodological issues in the applications of MDFMs and pointed out possible directions for future research.},

The contributions of the present proposal are: the development of a taxonomy of events and scenarios, the ranking of alternatives based on the criticality of the risk, considering financial losses, and finally, the provision of information regarding the causes of information system attacks of highest managerial relevance for organizations. We included an illustrative example regarding a data center aiming to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. To assess its robustness, we analyzed twelve alternatives considering two different methods of setting probabilities of the occurrence of events.

abstract = {This study analyzes variations in the rates at which North Carolina citizens apply for and are issued concealed carry permits (CCPs). Various theories, primarily those related to fear of/response to crime, demographic/geographic factors, and social learning theories of gun ownership, guide the analysis. Generally speaking, the authors find little support for socioeconomic and demographic explanations of CCPs in North Carolina. In addition, the authors find no support for the notion that violent or property crimes, or changes in these crimes over time, affect CCP policy. The authors do find some evidence that change in minority population (Black, but not Hispanic) is significantly related to permitting. In North Carolina, there is support for a cultural model of CCPs. Both the political conservatism and the proportion of hunters in the population (our indicator of a cultural norm that values and cherishes gun ownership) are consistently related to permitting. The authors conclude that the combination of political conservatism and socialization into a hunting/ gun-owning culture are more important than socioeconomic variables in explaining CCPs.

At the methodological level, we review how quantifications of net intraindividual variability and models of time-structured intraindividual variability are used to measure and describe dynamic characteristics and processes.

In its first step, the proposed framework encompasses fuzzy logic, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to formalize stakeholders' goals and objectives. In the second step, the assessments made on each patient's condition are integrated by data envelopment analysis (DEA) and compared among them by a min–max regret approach (MRA) to obtain a primary prioritization of patients. The third step uses the delay ratio, the risk criteria score, and a profile matrix to introduce dynamic aspects related to the evolution of patients' condition and changes in the patient's list to the prioritization process. This three-step framework not only considers the surgery team members' opinions but also considers the patient's opinions in the decision-making process.

Findings indicate that satisfaction with leisure time is a consistently stronger indicator of overall leisure satisfaction than satisfaction with leisure activities. About half of the variance in leisure satisfaction is stable trait variance, with the remaining variance being mostly occasion-specific and to a lesser extent attributable to shared method variance and error. However, these findings depend on the age group we consider. Several socio-demographic variables relate directly to the trait aspect of leisure satisfaction.

abstract = {Trait mindfulness, or the capacity for nonjudgmental, present-centered attention, predicts lower aggression in cross-sectional samples, an effect mediated by reduced anger rumination. Experimental work also implicates state mindfulness (i.e., fluctuations around one's typical mindfulness) in aggression. Despite evidence that both trait and state mindfulness predict lower aggression, their relative impact and their mechanisms remain unclear. Higher trait mindfulness and state increases in mindfulness facets may reduce aggression-related outcomes by (1) limiting the intensity of anger, or (2) limiting rumination on anger experiences. The present study tests two hypotheses: first, that both trait and state mindfulness contribute unique variance to lower aggressiveness, and second, that the impact of both trait and state mindfulness on aggressiveness will be uniquely partially mediated by both anger intensity and anger rumination. Eighty-six participants completed trait measures of mindfulness, anger intensity, and anger rumination, and then completed diaries for 35 days assessing mindfulness, anger intensity, anger rumination, anger expression, and self-reported and behavioral aggressiveness. Using multilevel zero-inflated regression, we examined unique contributions of trait and state mindfulness facets to daily anger expression and aggressiveness. We also examined the mediating roles of anger intensity and anger rumination at both trait and state levels. Mindfulness facets predicted anger expression and aggressiveness indirectly through anger rumination after controlling for indirect pathways through anger intensity. Individuals with high or fluctuating aggression may benefit from mindfulness training to reduce both intensity of and rumination on anger.},

abstract = {In longitudinal studies with short time lags, classical models of latent state-trait (LST) theory that assume no carry-over effects between neighboring occasions of measurement are often inappropriate, and have to be extended by including autoregressive effects. The way in which autoregressive effects should be defined in LST models is still an open question. In a recently published revision of LST theory (LST-R theory), Steyer, Mayer, Geiser, and Cole (2015) stated that the trait-state-occasion (TSO) model (Cole, Martin, {\&} Steiger, 2005), one of the most widely applied LST models with autoregressive effects, is not an LST-R model, implying that proponents of LST-R theory might recommend not to apply the TSO model. In the present article, we show that a version of the TSO model can be defined on the basis of LST-R theory and that some of its restrictions can be reasonably relaxed. Our model is based on the idea that situational effects can change time-specific dispositions, and it makes full use of the basic idea of LST-R theory that dispositions to react to situational influences are dynamic and malleable. The latent variables of the model have a clear meaning that is explained in detail.},

The first algorithm is used to convert an unacceptable hesitant fuzzy preference relation to an acceptable one. The second algorithm is utilized to help the group reach a predefined consensus level.

An empirical application to the repeated measurement of mood states (N = 501) revealed that a model with 2 latent classes fits the data well. The larger class (76{\%}) consists of individuals whose mood is highly variable, whose general well-being is comparatively lower, and whose mood variability is influenced by daily hassles and uplifts. The smaller class (24{\%}) represents individuals who are rather stable and happier and whose mood is influenced only by daily uplifts but not by daily hassles. A simulation study on the model without covariates with 5 sets of sample sizes and 5 sets of number of occasions revealed that the appropriateness of the parameter estimates of this model depends on number of observations (the higher the better) and number of occasions (the higher the better).

abstract = {A lot of attention has been given to education as it is the most practical way of improving social mobility. In order to be progressive and resilient, there has to be an overall transformation of society as evidenced in the annual budget allocations which has educational implications to it. Therefore, schools will come to term that they are under the watching eyes of interested parties who want them to perform academically. Thus, this will lead the stakeholders of education to make assessment and comparison between schools. However, the process of assessing schools is not an easy task as it involves many attributes. The problem of aggregating a large number of attributes will be a challenge if we use the traditional Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. Hence, in this paper an innovative approach called Evidential Reasoning (ER) will be used to assess school performance in a multilevel or hierarchical setting which involved indirect measurement of quality by using standardized examination results, rather than directly measuring the quality of the processes unfolding within the schools. The approach is different from most conventional decision making modeling methods in that it employs a belief structure to represent an assessment as a distribution. By using this method, we are able to assess and rank the schools involved by giving an appropriate weight and merit point for each attribute and grade, respectively. For easy comprehension of the method, a numerical example was given on how to utilize the proposed method in order to obtain a single performance figure for school ranking purposes. Finally, by comparing the school ranking reveals that there is little similarity with the normal practice currently adopted.

abstract = {The intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (IFPR) was introduced by Xu to efficiently deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) exhibit the characteristics of affirmation, negation and hesitation for the preference degrees over paired comparisons of alternatives. In this paper, two new approaches to group decision making (GDM) are proposed to derive the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy priority weights from IFPRs based on the order consistency and the multiplicative consistency. First, the concepts of order consistency and weak transitivity for IFPRs are introduced, and followed by a discussion of their desirable properties. Then, in order to convert the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy priority weights into multiplicative consistent IFPR, a transformation approach is investigated. Two linear optimization models are further developed to derive the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy weight vector for both individual and group IFPRs with the principle of minimizing the deviations between any provided IFPR and the converted multiplicative consistent IFPR, and the optimal deviation values obtained from the models enable us to improve the multiplicative consistency of IFPRs. Finally, based on the order consistency and the multiplicative consistency, two new algorithms for GDM are presented. Several numerical examples are provided, and comparative analyses with existing approaches are performed to demonstrate that the proposed methods are both valid and practical to deal with group decision making problems.

Since the literature suggests that none of these factors alone can explain the gender informal care gap, we develop a model based on fuzzy-set/qualitative comparative analysis in order to identify patterns in the relationship between the factors. The analysis conducted at the macro-national level in 13 European countries, suggests thatat the macro-level, the availability of public care services is crucial to understanding the gender informal care gap, while women's labour market position, the presence or absence of gendered care attitudes and the level of care needs play no or a relatively minor role.

In this study, the cross-disciplinary approaches for uncertainty analyses are identified and a modified approach suitable for industrial safety risk assessment is proposed using fuzzy set theory and Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed method is applied to a benzene extraction unit (BEU) of a chemical plant. The case study results show that the proposed method provides better measure of uncertainty than the existing methods as unlike traditional risk analysis method this approach takes into account both variability and uncertainty of information into risk calculation, and instead of a single risk value this approach provides interval value of risk values for a given percentile of risk. The implications of these results in terms of risk control and regulatory compliances are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {An increasing number of researchers in psychology are collecting intensive longitudinal data in order to study psychological processes on an intraindividual level. An increasingly popular way to analyze these data is autoregressive time series modeling; either by modeling the repeated measures for a single individual using classic n = 1 autoregressive models, or by using multilevel extensions of these models, with the dynamics for each individual modeled at Level 1 and interindividual differences in these dynamics modeled at Level 2. However, while it is widely accepted in psychology that psychological measurements usually contain a certain amount of measurement error, the issue of measurement error is largely neglected in applied psychological (autoregressive) time series modeling: The regular autoregressive model incorporates innovations, or "dynamic errors," but not measurement error. In this article we discuss the concepts of reliability and measurement error in the context of dynamic (VAR(1)) models, and the consequences of disregarding measurement error variance in the data. For this purpose, we present a preliminary model that accounts for measurement error for constructs that are measured with a single indicator. We further discuss how this model could be used to investigate the between-person reliability of the measurements, as well as the (person-specific) withinperson reliabilities and any individual differences in these reliabilities. We illustrate the consequences of assuming perfect reliability, the preliminary model, and reliabilities, using an empirical application in which we relate women's general positive affect to their positive affect concerning their romantic relationship. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Psychological Association.},

The aim of the article is to address some substantive analysis questions in the SIMS data and show the potential of multilevel factor analysis methodology. Issues related to between‐ and within‐class decomposition of achievement variance and the change of this decomposition over the course of the eighth grade are studied. As a starting point, random effects ANOVA is considered for each achievement score. Each score contains a large amount of measurement error. The effects of unreliability on variance decomposition are shown with the help of a multilevel factor analysis model. Unreliability has severely distorting effects on this type of ANOVA while multilevel factor analysis gives results corresponding to what would be obtained with perfectly reliable scores.

This paper introduces foundational concepts in IRT, as well as commonly used models and their assumptions. Existing data on a combined sample (n = 636) of Korean American and Vietnamese American adults who responded to the High Blood Pressure Health Literacy Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 are used to exemplify typical applications of IRT. These examples illustrate how IRT can be used to improve the development, refinement, and evaluation of PRO measures.

Of main interest is the performance of these estimators in relatively small samples (200 to 400) and the comparison of their performance with the normal theory maximum likelihood estimator given an increasing number of response categories. The evaluation of the performance of these estimators concerns the variability of the parameter estimates, the bias of the parameter estimates, the distribution of the parameter estimates and the $\chi$2 goodness‐of‐fit statistics. The model used in the simulation is an 8‐indicator single common factor model. The effect of model size (12‐ and 16‐indicator models) on the categorical item estimator of LISREL 7 is investigated briefly. The results indicate that in the ideal circumstances of the simulation study, 200 is too small a sample size to justify the use of large sample statistics associated with these estimators. 1994 The British Psychological Society},

abstract = {Traditionally, researchers have used time series and multilevel models to analyze intensive longitudinal data. However, these models do not directly address traits and states which conceptualize the stability and variability implicit in longitudinal research, and they do not explicitly take into account measurement error. An alternative to overcome these drawbacks is to consider structural equation models (state-trait SEMs) for longitudinal data that represent traits and states as latent variables. Most of these models are encompassed in the latent state-trait (LST) theory. These state-trait SEMs can be problematic when the number of measurement occasions increases. As they require the data to be in wide format, these models quickly become overparameterized and lead to nonconvergence issues. For these reasons, multilevel versions of state-trait SEMs have been proposed, which require the data in long format. To study how suitable state-trait SEMs are for intensive longitudinal data, we carried out a simulation study. We compared the traditional single level to the multilevel version of three state-trait SEMs. The selected models were the multistate-singletrait (MSST) model, the common and unique trait-state (CUTS) model, and the trait-state-occasion (TSO) model. Furthermore, we also included an empirical application. Our results indicated that the TSO model performed best in both the simulated and the empirical data. To conclude, we highlight the usefulness of state-trait SEMs to study the psychometric properties of the questionnaires used in intensive longitudinal data. Yet, these models still have multiple limitations, some of which might be overcome by extending them to more general frameworks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

The connection with existing psychometric and statistical methods is particularly emphasized, focusing on the notion of a membership value as a random variable as a means to assess uncertainty in assignment.

abstract = {Multivariate psychological processes have recently been studied, visualized, and analyzed as networks. In this network approach, psychological constructs are represented as complex systems of interacting components. In addition to insightful visualization of dynamics, a network perspective leads to a new way of thinking about the nature of psychological phenomena by offering new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology. In this article, we explain the rationale of the network approach, the associated methods and visualization, and illustrate it using an empirical example focusing on the relation between the daily fluctuations of emotions and neuroticism. The results suggest that individuals with high levels of neuroticism had a denser emotion network compared with their less neurotic peers. This effect is especially pronounced for the negative emotion network, which is in line with previous studies that found a denser network in depressed subjects than in healthy subjects.

The study presents a model that shows that absorptive capacity, particularly exploitation capability, mediates the relationship between training and organizational performance. Three analysis methods converge with the findings: case studies (6 cases), PLS-SEM (112 cases), and fsQCA (25 cases). Using these three data analysis methods in a single piece of research represents a considerable methodological contribution and enables the confirmation of the model's validity and robustness. Another of the contributions is that the use of fsQCA overcomes other methods' deficiencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {This paper questions findings indicating that when organizations are hard to classify they will suffer in terms of external evaluations. Here, I suggest this depends on the audience evaluating the organization. Audiences that are "market-takers" consume or evaluate goods and use market labels to find and assess organizations; for them, ambiguous labels make organizations unclear and therefore less appealing. "Market-makers" are interested in redefining the market structure, and as a result, this type of audience sees the same ambiguity as flexible and therefore more appealing. I tested these ideas in a longitudinal analysis of U.S. software organizations between 1990 and 2002. As predicted, organizations that claim ambiguous labels are less appealing to consumers, an audience of market-takers, but more appealing to venture capitalists, who are market-makers. Further, when labels are ambiguous, aversion to or preference for ambiguity arises from the label itself. Identifying with multiple ambiguous labels does not make an organization even less appealing to a consumer or more appealing to a venture capitalist. Finally, all types of venture capitalists are not alike in how they react to a label's ambiguity. Independent venture capitalists act as market-makers and prefer organizations with ambiguous labels, while corporate venture capitalists act as market-takers and avoid them.},

abstract = {The use of ambulatory assessment (AA; Trull {\&} Ebner-Priemer, 2013) in psychopathology research, which includes experience-sampling methods as well as ecological momentary assessment, has increased dramatically over the last several decades. Previously, methodological and reporting guidelines have been presented to outline best practices and provide input on methodological issues and decisions that are faced when planning and conducting AA studies (e.g., Bolger {\&} Laurenceau, 2013; Mehl {\&} Conner, 2012; Stone {\&} Shiffman, 2002). However, despite the publication of these important resources and guidelines, it remains an open question as to how much uniformity or consistency is evident in the design and reporting of AA studies of psychopathology. To address this, we reviewed the reported practices of published studies using AA in major psychopathology journals (Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Psychological Medicine, Clinical Psychological Science) over the last 7 years (2012-2018). Our review highlights (a) sample selection and size; (b) sampling design; (c) selection and reporting of measures; (d) devices used and software; (e) compliance; (f) participant training, monitoring and remuneration; and (g) data management and analysis. We conclude with recommendations for reporting the features of future AA studies in psychopathology.},

abstract = {Scholars have long studied the conditions under which the cabinet making process will result in minority, surplus majority, or minimum-winning governing coalitions in parliamentary systems. Since Riker, a good number of these attempts have been based on rational choice assumptions. Among formal approaches in this vein, Laver and Shepsle's (Making and breaking governments: Cabinets and legislatures in parliamentary governments, 1996) "portfolio allocation model" argues that parties centrally located in policy space have a greater potential for being part of any governing coalition and that parties located at the issue-by-issue median have a high likelihood of forming a minority government. However, the model predicts that surplus majority coalitions will only form when the number of salient policy dimensions in the political system is greater than two. We incorporate fuzzy set theory in the "portfolio allocation model", permitting us to model ambiguity in parties' policy preferences. The reformulated model accounts for the formation of surplus majority coalitions in two-dimensional policy space. We illustrate the model's conclusions with a case study of the 1996 surplus majority coalition in the Lithuanian Seimas.},

A three-level model examined daily event items as functions of their valence (negative vs. positive), domain (social vs. achievement), and their interaction (level 1); and the extent to which daily personality moderated these effects (level 2) for the average person (level 3). It revealed 4 three-way interactions. For extraversion and agreeableness, valence×personality interactions emerged for social—but not achievement—events. For neuroticism, valence×personality interactions emerged for both domains, but social was stronger. For conscientiousness, a valence×personality interaction emerged for achievement—but not social—events. We discuss whether daily personality shapes daily event experiences or vice versa.},

Several hypotheses are put to the test: first, a classical partisan difference argument; second, a varieties of capitalism approach proposing a successful joint rallying of employers and employees for subsidization in coordinated market economies; and, lastly, the merged hypothesis that right-wing parties in a coordinated economic context might subsidize feeling the pressure to overcompensate an 'issue ownership' of left parties in the field of employee-friendly policies. We identify four explanatory paths: coordinated economies in the sample subsidized when they were economically closed or highly indebted. The results also support our combined hypothesis, that New Zealand - a left-governed liberal market economy - and right-governed coordinated market economies of the non-Scandinavian type subsidized.

abstract = {However, it has an indirect effect on homicide through its significant positive effect on robbery rates, which in turn positively affect homicide rates. While 60 percent of the homicides in the the past 30 years were committed with firearms, gun ownership among the law-abiding poses no direct risk of crime or violence in the community. Thus the only justification for disarming the majority of the population is to deny violence-prone persons easy access to firearms owned by the law-abiding. General levels of ownership either of all gun types, handguns only, or long guns only are all positively affected by crime rates. Although most gun ownership is motivated by recreational and sport concerns, a significant part of it is oriented toward protection of the self, family, and home, and is a response to reported rates of crime, sometimes to prior victimization, and to the fear of victimization that these engender. These conclusions probably apply to both the law-abiding and the nonlaw-abiding, although research has not distinguished between the two groups. Eight tables and 57 footnotes are provided.},

@article{Stroebe2013,
abstract = {This article critically reviews the empirical research on the association of firearm possession with suicide and homicide. Both suicide and homicide reflect intentional behavior with the goal of killing oneself or another person. Firearms provide merely a means of reaching this goal. The possession of a firearm can, therefore, not be a primary cause of either suicide or homicide. However, since a defining characteristic of both suicide and homicide is the success of killing, and since guns are more effective means for reaching this goal than poison or other weapons, the rate of firearm possession can be expected to be positively related to overall rates of suicide and homicide. This prediction has been tested with individual-level as well as macro-level studies. Individual-level studies, which typically use case–control designs, allow a better control than macro-level studies of the cultural, demographic, and economic determinants of suicide and homicide. In macro-level studies, the potential impact of gun possession on overall rates is likely to be confounded by the factors that motivate people to commit suicide or homicide. Despite these methodological limitations, the research reviewed in this article supports the assumption that easy access to firearms increases the risk of dying from violent causes. With very few exception, studies found gun ownership positively related to gun-related suicides and homicides. Furthermore, there is evidence that guns do not merely serve as substitutes for other means of killing, but increase the overall rates of suicide and homicide.

However, recent evidence suggests that, while trait questionnaires and aggregated momentary assessments of personality are highly related, they may also differ in meaningful ways.

Results indicate that these two assessment strategies, although highly related, do not show convergence (r = .39–.64) levels that would signify an equity of constructs. In line with this, these two assessment strategies show differential predictive utility. Although the pattern of this differential predictive utility suggests that measurement error may account for differences, the difference between trait and mean state personality predicts affect in a manner consistent with self-discrepancy theory.

@article{Suchman2016,
abstract = {This paper reports on a data-driven effort to map the temporal and conceptual relationships among a range of entrepreneurial start-up activities -- developing a business model, incorporating, registering intellectual property, making first hires, and so on. Although timing and sequencing advice abounds in the practitioner literature on entrepreneurship, scholarly research to date has yielded unruly and inconclusive results. So much so, in fact, that many researchers have questioned whether reliable temporal regularities exist at all. Our results, however, suggest that such pessimism may be premature. Drawing on data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSEDII), we examine the incidence of 36 key start-up activities, across a sample of over 960 nascent business firms. We construct multiple indices of temporal similarity among these 36 activities, including patterns of: co-occurrence, substitutability, simultaneity, correlation, and sequentiality. We then subject these similarity indices to a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, in order to construct a map of the start-up "activity space." Results suggest that this space is spanned by two conceptually-plausible dimensions: timeline (early versus late), and modality (operational versus constitutive). Moreover, these underlying dimensions - and the positions of specific start-up activities along these - remain remarkably consistent across various subsets of otherwise distinct ventures. In addition to being of interest in their own right, our findings provide an important first step toward more sophisticated analyses of start-up sequences, holding the potential to advance entrepreneurship research beyond the question of whether start-up stages exist, to more complex and potentially fruitful questions about: (a) the relative similarity and dissimilarity of real-world start-up trajectories; (b) the clustering of trajectories into archetypes, hybrids, and sports; (c) the association of particular archetypes with particular sectors, logics, demographies, and regions; and (d) the performance and survival consequences of conformity to, and deviance from, dominant gestational models. Although there is almost certainly no single "right" way to launch an organization, there may nonetheless be consistent, discernible, theorizable regularities in how new organizations come into being in different contexts.

abstract = {Current approaches to model responses and response times to psychometric tests solely focus on between-subject differences in speed and ability. Within subjects, speed and ability are assumed to be constants. Violations of this assumption are generally absorbed in the residual of the model. As a result, within-subject departures from the between-subject speed and ability level remain undetected. These departures may be of interest to the researcher as they reflect differences in the response processes adopted on the items of a test. In this article, we propose a dynamic approach for responses and response times based on hidden Markov modeling to account for within-subject differences in responses and response times. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate acceptable parameter recovery and acceptable performance of various fit indices in distinguishing between different models. In addition, both a confirmatory and an exploratory application are presented to demonstrate the practical value of the modeling approach.},

abstract = {This article examines 4 approaches for explaining shared method variance, each applied to a longitudinal trait–state–occasion (TSO) model. Many approaches have been developed to account for shared method variance in multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data. Some of these MTMM approaches (correlated method, orthogonal method, correlated method minus one, correlated uniqueness) were therefore borrowed in these analyses such that their effectiveness could be evaluated in conjunction with a TSO model. To this end, datasets were generated according to 4 different covariance matrices (each created according to specifications of a model built with 1 of the 4 approaches) and each model was crossed with each type of data. Whereas the correlated method and correlated method minus one approaches encountered many difficulties in convergence, fit, or parameter estimates, the correlated uniqueness and orthogonal method approaches proved to be quite versatile.},

The TSO allows distinguishing the trait and the state components of the psychological constructs measured in longitudinal data, while also taking into account the carry-over effects between consecutive measurements. In the present study, we extend a multilevel version of the TSO model to allow for the combination of fixed and random situations, namely the mixed-effects TSO (ME-TSO). Hence, the ME-TSO model is a measurement model suitable to analyze intensive longitudinal data that allows studying the psychometric properties of the indicators per individual, the heterogeneity of psychological dynamics, and the person–situation interaction effects. We showcase how to use the model by analyzing the items of positive affect activation of the crowdsourcing study HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekisNL).},

abstract = {Internalizing symptoms during adolescence and beyond is a major public health concern, particularly because severe symptoms can lead to the diagnosis of a number of serious psychiatric conditions. This study utilizes a unique sample with a complex statistical method in order to explore Gene × Environment interactions found in internalizing symptoms during adolescence. Data for this study were drawn from a longitudinal prevention intervention study (n = 798) of Baltimore city school children. Internalizing symptom data were collected using self-report and blood or saliva samples genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0 microarrays. A major depression polygenic score was created for each individual using information from the major depressive disorder Psychiatric Genetics Consortium and used as a predictor in a latent trait-state-occasion model. The major depressive disorder polygenic score was a significant predictor of the stable latent trait variable, which captures time-independent phenotypic variability. In addition, an early childhood stressor of death or divorce was a significant predictor of occasion-specific variables. A Gene × Environment interaction was not a significant predictor of the latent trait or occasion variables. These findings support the importance of genetics on the stable latent trait portion of internalizing symptoms across adolescence.},

Although weapon-associated juvenile violence has declined since the mid-1990s, research indicates that juveniles have easy access to firearms and that delinquent juveniles are more likely than non delinquent juveniles to own and carry guns and other weapons. However, there are no empirical data that indicate that the majority of juvenile gun owners or weapon carriers are delinquents. Thus, for purposes of policy and program development, a distinction should be drawn between (a) juveniles who own and carry firearms and other weapons for legitimate reasons and (b) juveniles who own and carry firearms and other weapons for crime-related reasons.

abstract = {Fear of crime often pushes individuals to seek protection from victimization. One response to such fear is the purchase of a firearm for home, family, and self protection. Specifically, this report attempts to answer questions, such as what proportion of judges personally support legal rights to own guns for protection, bans on handgun ownership, guns as effective tools for home defense, carrying a firearm in one's vehicle for protection, and actual ownership of a firearm in the home. Findings indicate the existence of strong support for firearms as a means of personal protection among the judges surveyed. However, the vast majority of judges disapproved of the practice of carrying a weapon in one's car. There were no statistically significant attitudinal differences between district and superior court judges.

abstract = {The NSPOF used a list-assisted random-digit-dial sampling method in which each telephone household has essentially equal likelihood of being selected; a total of 2,568 adults were interviewed. Since those who refused to participate in the survey may be different from participants, the authors urge caution in the interpretation of results based on NSPOF data. Findings show that approximately 192 million working firearms are in private possession, about one-third of which are handguns. About one- quarter of American adults personally own a firearm (42 percent for men and 9 percent for women); gun ownership is most prevalent among middle-aged, middle-class whites from rural areas. Gun owners with four or more guns, approximately 10 percent of the Nation's adults, own about 77 percent of the total stock of firearms. Most handgun owners have a handgun primarily for self- defense; nevertheless, two-thirds of all handgun owners also own at least one rifle or shotgun, suggesting some experience and interest in the sporting uses of guns. Overall, 46 percent of gun owners own some kind of gun primarily for protection against crime. Most guns were acquired through cash purchases from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Survey findings suggest that 1.5 million gun owners use their guns defensively in 4.7 million defensive gun uses each year. The discussion of these survey findings on defensive uses of guns provides evidence that these estimates of the number of defensive gun uses, along with the number of firearms accidents, are too high by an order of magnitude or more.

abstract = {By modeling variables over time it is possible to investigate the Granger-causal cross-lagged associations between variables. By comparing the standardized cross-lagged coefficients, the relative strength of these associations can be evaluated in order to determine important driving forces in the dynamic system. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to illustrate the added value of a multilevel multivariate autoregressive modeling approach for investigating these associations over more traditional techniques; and second, to discuss how the coefficients of the multilevel autoregressive model should be standardized for comparing the strength of the cross-lagged associations. The hierarchical structure of multilevel multivariate autoregressive models complicates standardization, because subject-based statistics or group-based statistics can be used to standardize the coefficients, and each method may result in different conclusions. We argue that in order to make a meaningful comparison of the strength of the cross-lagged associations, the coefficients should be standardized within persons. We further illustrate the bivariate multilevel autoregressive model and the standardization of the coefficients, and we show that disregarding individual differences in dynamics can prove misleading, by means of an empirical example on experienced competence and exhaustion in persons diagnosed with burnout.

A simulation study suggested that the parallel tests approach and the structural equation modeling approach recovered the simulated reliability coefficients. Then in an empirical study, where 45 females were measured daily on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) for 45 consecutive days, separate estimates of reliability were generated for each person. Results showed that reliability estimates of the PANAS varied substantially from person to person. The methods provided in this article apply to tests measuring changeable attributes and require repeated measures across time on each individual.
