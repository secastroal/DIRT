# Dynamic Item Response Theory (DIRT)
This project aims to develop polytomous item response theory models suitable to analyze intensive longitudinal psychological data. In particular, we are extending the partial credit model and the graded response model in order to analyze multivariate time series data (i.e., N = 1).
